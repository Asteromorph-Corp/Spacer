Living insects serve as biocatalytic reactors where endogenous cytochrome P450 enzymes perform direct oxygen insertion into carbon-carbon bonds of rigid nanocarbon substrates, exploiting high-density multi-enzyme environments to achieve regioselective oxidations impossible through conventional chemistry while revealing P450 mechanisms for accommodating bulky substrates.
