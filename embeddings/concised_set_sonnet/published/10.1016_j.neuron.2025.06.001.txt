Movement temporal patterns encode cognitive states through a bidirectional mechanism where behavioral variability paradoxically enhances neural predictability during disengagement by reducing stereotypy, while manipulating movement structure causally modulates cognitive engagement, revealing how embodied signatures interface with distributed neural representations.
