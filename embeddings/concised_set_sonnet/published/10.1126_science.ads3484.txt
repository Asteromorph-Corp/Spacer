Genomic Centromere Profiling exploits conserved spatial arrangements of centromeric DNA motifs to generate diagnostic architectural signatures, bypassing sequence divergence limitations that confound traditional methods. This motif-positioning approach enables detection of cryptic structural variants and centromere expansion events while revealing evolutionary constraints governing chromosomal stability across species.
