PTSD pathophysiology emerges from coordinated molecular disruptions across multiple prefrontal cortex cell types rather than single-cell dysfunction. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics will map trauma-induced transcriptomic changes across neuronal, glial, and vascular populations, revealing how intercellular network perturbations generate PTSD's complex symptomatology.
