Redox-induced multimerization of AUX/IAA proteins creates a titratable repression system that quantitatively links environmental stress intensity to auxin signaling specificity. This mechanism exploits differential cysteine sensitivities among family members to generate tissue-specific transcriptional responses, revealing how post-translational modifications dynamically integrate stress perception with developmental plasticity.
