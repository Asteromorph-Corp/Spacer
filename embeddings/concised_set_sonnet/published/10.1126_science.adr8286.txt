Bacterial type VI secretion systems function as molecular weapons that kill neighboring cells to harvest their nutrients, with metabolically streamlined species showing greater dependence on this contact-dependent predation strategy, fundamentally restructuring microbial ecosystems through antagonism-driven nutrient cycling networks.
