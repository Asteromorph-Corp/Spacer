Ribosomal RNA processing steps function as programmable molecular instructions directing transcript movement through sequential nucleolar phases, with specific maturation defects predictably disrupting phase architecture. Using spatiotemporal mapping and synthetic nucleoli engineering, this research tests whether processing checkpoints gate inter-phase transport, revealing RNA's dual role as scaffold and regulatory substrate in organizing biomolecular condensates.
