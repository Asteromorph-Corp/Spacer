HaloDA1.0's unique far-red spectral properties enable simultaneous monitoring of dopamine release, calcium dynamics, and cAMP signaling across brain regions during behavior. This multiplexed imaging approach reveals previously undetectable temporal sequences and crosstalk between dopamine and other neuromodulatory systems, elucidating how integrated neurochemical networks coordinate information processing.
