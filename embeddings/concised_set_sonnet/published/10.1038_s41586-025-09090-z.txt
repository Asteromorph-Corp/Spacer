Therapeutic biosynthetic genes organize into distinct co-expression modules representing consecutive enzymatic subpathways, which multiplexed perturbation single-nuclei profiling can systematically decode by capturing transcriptional states across tissues, cell types, and elicitation conditions that conventional RNA-sequencing cannot resolve, enabling complete pathway reconstruction in complex plant genomes.
