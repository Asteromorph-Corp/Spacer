Dopamine enables precise striatal computation through dual-pathway subcellular compartmentalization, where membrane-delimited Gβγ signaling produces rapid, spatially restricted responses while second messenger cascades generate slower, diffuse signals. Two-photon imaging will map how this spatiotemporal segregation within spiny projection neuron dendrites transforms broad dopamine release into behaviorally-specific outputs.
