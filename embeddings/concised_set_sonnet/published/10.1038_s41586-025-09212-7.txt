Tumor-restricted promoters from genes like NR4A2 and RGS16 will drive spatially-controlled cytokine expression in CAR T cells through CRISPR knock-in engineering. This endogenous regulatory hijacking strategy enables therapeutic payload delivery exclusively within tumor microenvironments, enhancing polyfunctionality while eliminating systemic toxicity inherent to constitutive expression systems.
