Livestock domestication 6,500 years ago fundamentally restructured zoonotic transmission by creating unprecedented human-animal contact densities and novel settlement configurations. An integrated archaeogenetic-ecological framework will quantify how pastoralist mobility patterns and domestication practices mechanistically drove pathogen spillover events, revealing the evolutionary origins of modern infectious disease landscapes.
