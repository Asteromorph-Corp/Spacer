Complex diseases arise from dysregulated multi-cellular signaling cascades involving sequential ligand-receptor interactions rather than simple pairwise communications. CellNEST computationally detects these relay-network patterns in spatial transcriptomics data, revealing how sequential cellular interactions coordinate tissue-level functions and identifying therapeutic targets within multi-step communication circuits.
