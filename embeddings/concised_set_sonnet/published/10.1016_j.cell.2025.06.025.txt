Programmable contact-dependent signaling and selective adhesion in synthetic yeast communities can generate predictable multicellular logic circuits mimicking natural development. By systematically varying signaling strength, adhesion specificity, and population density, this approach reveals how local cell-cell interactions scale to produce coordinated collective behaviors and controlled spatial organization.
