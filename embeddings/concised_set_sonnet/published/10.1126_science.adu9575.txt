Adult human hippocampal neurogenesis remains mechanistically opaque due to cellular heterogeneity within the dentate gyrus niche. Integrating single-nucleus transcriptomics with spatially-resolved immunohistochemistry will decode stage-specific molecular signatures of Ki67-positive progenitors, revealing how quiescent stem cells transition through committed neuroblast states and identifying niche-specific regulatory networks governing human neurogenic potential.
