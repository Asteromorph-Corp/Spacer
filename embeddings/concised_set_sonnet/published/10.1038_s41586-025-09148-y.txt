Thymic tolerance mechanisms co-evolved with vertebrate tissue complexity through sequential modifications of Foxn1 transcriptional networks that enabled coordinated waves of mimetic cell emergence. Comparative analysis using ancestral Foxn1 variants will reveal how evolutionary upgrades in thymic epithelial programming systematically expanded peripheral antigen expression to accommodate increasingly diverse self-antigens.
