GGCX undergoes topological membrane inversion to carboxylate cytoplasmic MAVS, enhancing antiviral interferon responses while suppressing apoptosis. This mechanism enables vitamin K-dependent enzymes to function beyond canonical membrane-bound roles, revealing how metabolic cofactors coordinate cellular defense through enzymatic versatility that bypasses traditional coagulation pathways.
