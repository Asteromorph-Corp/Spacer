Disease-induced peripheral nervous system remodeling drives whole-body dysfunction through selective reorganization of autonomic and sensory networks. High-speed volumetric imaging of cleared tissues will map cellular-resolution connectivity changes across pathological states, revealing how specific nerve architecture alterations—sympathetic perivascular remodeling in metabolic disorders, sensory fiber disruption in neuropathic pain—mechanistically link neural reorganization to physiological dysfunction.
