Cancer-associated neurons directly transfer mitochondria to malignant cells, creating metabolically enhanced subpopulations with superior metastatic capacity. This research employs novel MitoTRACER lineage tracing combined with metabolic profiling to demonstrate that neuronal mitochondrial donation drives cancer cell metabolic reprogramming and metastatic colonization, establishing mitochondrial transfer as a targetable nerve-cancer communication mechanism.
