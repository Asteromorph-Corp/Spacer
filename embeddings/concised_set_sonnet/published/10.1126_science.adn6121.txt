Sequential morphogen priming unlocks transcription factor access to dormant regulatory networks that drive authentic neuronal subtype specification. High-throughput screening systematically varies morphogen-transcription factor timing to decode how temporal coordination between extrinsic gradients and intrinsic programs generates the full spectrum of neural diversity during development.
