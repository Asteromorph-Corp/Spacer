CSF1R-normal microglia transplantation rescues neurodegeneration by restoring disrupted phagocytic clearance, inflammatory signaling, and synaptic pruning functions in monoallelic CSF1R mutation models. This approach uniquely correlates therapeutic timing with molecular rescue signatures to identify critical intervention windows that prevent axonal spheroid formation and white matter degeneration.
