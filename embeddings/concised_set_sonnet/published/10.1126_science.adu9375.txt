Micropatterned human pluripotent stem cell gastruloids will test whether conserved developmental programs drive vascularization across organ types by systematically applying vascular-inducing factors to cardiac and hepatic organoids, comparing network architectures and molecular signatures to identify universal versus organ-specific regulatory mechanisms governing early human vascular development.
