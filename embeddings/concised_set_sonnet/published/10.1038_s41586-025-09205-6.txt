Catalytic function hierarchically constrains enzyme evolution through selective pressures operating at different structural scales. This framework integrates structural prediction with phylogenetic analysis to quantify how active-site conservation and surface plasticity create predictable evolutionary trajectories across metabolic networks, revealing mechanistic principles governing molecular function-evolution relationships.
