Telomerase dimerization through H/ACA RNP interfaces functions as a regulatory checkpoint controlling chromosomal recruitment and synthesis efficiency. Engineering interface-specific mutations that preserve monomeric activity while disrupting dimer formation will reveal whether dimerization governs processivity, substrate selectivity, or localizationâ€”distinguishing regulatory control from quality assurance mechanisms.
