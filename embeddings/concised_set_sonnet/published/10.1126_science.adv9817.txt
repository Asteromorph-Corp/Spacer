BioEmu employs deep learning to rapidly generate thousands of statistically independent protein conformations per hour, emulating equilibrium ensembles that capture functionally relevant dynamics like cryptic pocket formation. This ensemble-based approach uniquely integrates molecular dynamics, structural data, and experimental measurements to predict relative free energies within 1 kcal/mol accuracy while dramatically accelerating traditional simulation timescales.
