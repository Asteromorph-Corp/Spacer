Mitochondria offload excess ROS to peroxisomes through ACBD5-PTPIP51 contact sites, creating an interorganellar antioxidant relay system where peroxisomal catalase serves as an external mitochondrial defense mechanism, fundamentally redefining cellular redox homeostasis as a coordinated multiorganelle process rather than compartment-autonomous protection.
