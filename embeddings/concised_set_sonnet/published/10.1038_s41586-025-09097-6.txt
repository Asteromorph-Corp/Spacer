Metabolic enzymes actively determine cell fate by creating lineage-specific αKG microenvironments that drive chromatin modifications during intestinal differentiation. HNF4-regulated OGDH expression establishes distinct metabolic states—high in absorptive cells for bioenergetic maintenance, low in secretory precursors to elevate αKG for epigenetic activation—revealing TCA intermediates as direct signaling molecules controlling tissue identity.
