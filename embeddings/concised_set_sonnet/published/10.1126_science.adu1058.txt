Enzyme sequence-catalysis landscapes exhibit catalytically heterogeneous neighborhoods organized by structural motifs, revealed through high-throughput microfluidic kinetic profiling of hundreds of enzyme variants integrated with semisupervised machine learning models that combine experimental measurements with protein language representations to illuminate mechanistic principles governing enzyme evolution.
