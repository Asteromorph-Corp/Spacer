The Zincore complex employs an arginine clamp mechanism to convert transient zinc finger protein-DNA interactions into stable transcriptional complexes. We will test whether this DNA-locking strategy represents a universal recognition system across diverse ZNF families, distinguishing initial binding from transcriptional stabilization through selective mutagenesis and cross-family validation studies.
