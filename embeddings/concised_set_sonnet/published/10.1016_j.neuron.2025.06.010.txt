Transplanted human interneurons follow distinct transcriptional programs during subtype specification, suggesting that manipulating key molecular regulators governing migration, synaptogenesis, and membrane maturation can accelerate therapeutic cell integration and enhance seizure suppression in drug-resistant epilepsy through optimized GABAergic circuit assembly.
