SP140 functions as a spatially-organized molecular switch within nuclear bodies, coordinating antiviral immunity by recruiting distinct effector complexes—CCR4-NOT deadenylase for interferon regulation versus chromatin silencing factors for direct viral suppression—enabling compartmentalized dual-pathway immune responses through selective effector-triggered mechanisms.
