Computational enzyme design achieves natural-level catalytic efficiency by systematically repurposing TIM-barrel protein backbones as scaffolds for novel active sites. This purely computational approach challenges the assumption that experimental optimization is essential, targeting catalytic efficiencies exceeding 10^5 M^-1 s^-1 through strategic backbone fragment integration and active site programming.
