Tellurium nanowire networks generate localized electric field gradients that enable broad-spectrum photoconversion from visible to near-infrared-II wavelengths. Strategic manipulation of nanowire architecture exploits these gradients to enhance charge separation efficiency, creating neural stimulation patterns that mimic natural photoreceptor responses for advanced retinal prosthetics.
