Mechanically-induced conformational changes in Î±-actinin crosslinkers cascade through actomyosin networks to amplify local mechanosensitive switches into cell-scale polarized contractility. Near-infrared optogenetics combined with super-resolution microscopy will causally link molecular conformational triggers to network-level force asymmetries, revealing hierarchical mechanisms underlying cortical symmetry-breaking.
