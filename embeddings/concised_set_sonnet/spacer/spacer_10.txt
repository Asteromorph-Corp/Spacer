Transcriptional condensate rheological properties—viscosity and surface tension—function as tunable rheostats controlling transcription factor exchange dynamics and burst kinetics during cell fate transitions. Systematic manipulation of intrinsically disordered regions modulates condensate material properties without disrupting core protein function, directly linking condensate physics to transcriptional noise and developmental gene expression timing.
