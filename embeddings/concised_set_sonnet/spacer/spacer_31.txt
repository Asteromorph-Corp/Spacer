Voltage-gated calcium channel nanoclusters at axon initial segments create logic-based excitability control through spatially-confined calcium signaling that activates CaMKII to phosphorylate sodium channels, producing precise voltage shifts. This nanoscale calcium-kinase circuit, balanced by calcineurin feedback, explains how nanocluster mutations cause distinct neurological pathologies.
