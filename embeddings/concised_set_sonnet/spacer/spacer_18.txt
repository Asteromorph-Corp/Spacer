Mitochondrial-ER contact sites create phospholipid-regulated calcium microdomains that translate metabolic signals into regenerative transcription programs. Manipulating these membrane interfaces reveals how specific lipid compositions generate spatially-restricted calcium transients, with phospholipids like PIP2 directly modulating channel activity to transform systemic metabolic cues into precise transcriptional responses governing regeneration.
