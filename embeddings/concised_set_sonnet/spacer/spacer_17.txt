Clustered epigenetic modifications generate cumulative mechanical strain that drives chromatin into bistable topological conformations, where modification density triggers cooperative phase transitions between transcriptionally active and repressive states, creating mechanically-governed epigenetic switches that integrate biochemical signals with physical forces to establish heritable gene expression patterns.
