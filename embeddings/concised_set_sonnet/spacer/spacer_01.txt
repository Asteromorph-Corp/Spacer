Bacterial laccases will be structurally redesigned to oxidize persistent polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons by engineering substrate access channels through crystallographic-guided mutations that accommodate bulky aromatics while preserving copper-mediated catalysis, creating environmentally robust biocatalysts for direct PAH degradation without resistant intermediate formation.
