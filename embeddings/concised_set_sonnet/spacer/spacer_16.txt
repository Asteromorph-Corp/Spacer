Cytokine glycosylation patterns mechanically restructure lipid rafts through multivalent lectin-glycan interactions, creating mechanochemical coupling where inflammatory signal quality directly translates into distinct membrane compartmentalization states that regulate signaling propagation kinetics via altered membrane mechanical properties.
