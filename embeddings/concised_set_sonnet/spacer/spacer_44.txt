Stress disrupts circadian-controlled RNA-binding protein degradation, creating persistent transcript stability modifications that function as molecular memory. This mechanism enables stress timing relative to circadian phase to selectively reprogram immune gene decay kinetics, establishing adaptive priming where subsequent immune responses reflect the temporal context of prior stress encounters.
