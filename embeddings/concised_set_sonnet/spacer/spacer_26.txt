Competitive inhibition of cholesterol-sphingomyelin hydrogen bonding networks enables deterministic control over lipid raft stability below critical phase transition thresholds. Modified cholesterol analogues and bulky sphingomyelin substitutions systematically disrupt these stabilizing interactions, achieving predictable modulation of raft-dependent cellular processes while preserving essential membrane function.
