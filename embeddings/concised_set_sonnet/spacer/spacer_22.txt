FoxO transcription factors operate as combinatorial modification-controlled molecular switches that integrate oxidative stress signals into discrete bistable regulatory modes, mechanistically linking metabolic reprogramming between glycolytic and oxidative pathways to predictable cellular fate decisions through hierarchical post-translational modification patterns that create hysteretic rather than graded responses.
