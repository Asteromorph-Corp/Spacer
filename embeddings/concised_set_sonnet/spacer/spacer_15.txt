Age-related disruptions in neuronal-glial ion channel dynamics desynchronize oscillatory coupling that coordinates glymphatic protein clearance, enabling tau accumulation in Alzheimer's disease. Therapeutic restoration of specific ionic conductance patterns could re-synchronize membrane oscillations with glymphatic flow rhythms, mechanistically targeting tau pathology through enhanced clearance efficiency.
