Engineered anisotropic pore geometries create predictable neurotrophic factor gradients through differential diffusion kinetics, directing axonal growth along predetermined trajectories for neural circuit reconstruction while simultaneously releasing anti-inflammatory agents to prevent glial scarring and establish functional polysynaptic connections.
