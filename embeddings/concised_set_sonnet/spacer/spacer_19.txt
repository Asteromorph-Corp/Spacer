Phosphate scarcity in Archean oceans selected for promiscuous alkaline phosphatases with relaxed substrate specificity, enabling early metabolic diversification through multi-substrate catalysis. Ancestral sequence reconstruction will resurrect ancient enzymes to test whether broad specificity preceded specialized phosphatases, revealing how nutrient limitation drove enzymatic versatility.
