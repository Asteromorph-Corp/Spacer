Brown adipose tissue creates localized thermal microenvironments that directly modulate sympathetic nerve terminal function through temperature-dependent neurotransmitter release kinetics, establishing real-time feedback loops where metabolic heat generation dynamically regulates the neural circuits controlling energy expenditure at the tissue level.
