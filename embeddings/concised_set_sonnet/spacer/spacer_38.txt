Cellular state transitions follow predictable patterns determined by ATP allocation hierarchies across competing metabolic pathways, where systematic energy reallocation during differentiation creates quantifiable flux distributions that reflect underlying bioenergetic constraints and enable predictive modeling through reduced metabolic entropy.
