Matrix metalloproteinases rapidly liberate sequestered VEGF from extracellular matrix reservoirs, enabling angiogenesis through proteolytic release rather than hypoxia-dependent transcription. This mechanism generates localized VEGF gradients within hours by cleaving matrix proteins, offering targeted therapeutic intervention that bypasses traditional HIF-1Î± pathways for enhanced ischemic tissue vascularization.
