Mechanically-induced strain gradients in two-dimensional magnetic materials systematically engineer topological magnetic textures by exploiting magnetoelastic coupling to modulate local spin Hamiltonians. Controlled curvature breaks symmetries and tunes Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, enabling reversible skyrmion formation and emergent magnetism control through mechanical deformation as a precise tunable parameter.
