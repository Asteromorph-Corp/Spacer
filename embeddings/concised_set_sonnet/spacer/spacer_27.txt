Metabolic perturbations in medullary thymic epithelial cells alter self-peptide repertoires through mTOR/AMPK-mediated protein turnover, shifting negative selection thresholds and autoimmune susceptibility. This approach uniquely integrates cellular energetics with central tolerance mechanisms, revealing how metabolic checkpoints control immune self-recognition through tissue-restricted antigen processing modulation.
