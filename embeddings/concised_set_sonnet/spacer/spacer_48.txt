Injury-induced cholesterol redistribution disrupts TrkB receptor clustering in axonal lipid rafts, fundamentally altering calcium oscillation patterns that govern growth cone steering during neural regeneration, revealing cholesterol-dependent membrane reorganization as a novel therapeutic target for enhancing axonal repair through optimized neurotrophin signaling dynamics.
