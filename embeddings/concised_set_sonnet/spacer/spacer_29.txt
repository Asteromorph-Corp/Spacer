LINC complex proteins mechanically transmit cardiac stress from the nuclear envelope to chromatin, triggering force-induced spatial reorganization of three-dimensional genome architecture that precedes epigenetic modifications. This mechanotransmission pathway directly remodels topologically associating domains and heterochromatin boundaries at mechanosensitive enhancers, determining whether cardiac responses remain adaptive or transition to pathological fibrotic states.
