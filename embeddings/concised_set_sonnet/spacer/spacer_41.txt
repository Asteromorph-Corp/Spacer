Geometric archetypes in biomolecular interfaces reveal universal spatial patterns that predict binding specificity independent of sequence composition. This framework integrates curvature analysis, void mapping, and physicochemical descriptors to identify conserved three-dimensional motifs across diverse protein-ligand complexes, enabling sequence-agnostic prediction of molecular recognition through machine learning-derived spatial templates.
