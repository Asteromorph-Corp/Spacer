Nuclear pore complexes create spatially organized quality control microdomains where chaperone-karyopherin interactions establish proteostasis-dependent transport checkpoints, coupling protein folding surveillance to nucleocytoplasmic selectivity. This research demonstrates how aging disrupts these microdomains' architecture, simultaneously compromising transport function and stress responses, while revealing transport regulator interventions can restore spatial coupling to enhance cellular longevity.
