Energy depletion rewires TNF receptor signaling by disrupting ATP-dependent ubiquitination machinery, shifting complex assembly from death-promoting RIPK1 to survival-enhancing TRAF2/cIAP1 configurations. This metabolic control of receptor stoichiometry transforms necroptotic death signals into NF-ÎºB survival responses, revealing ubiquitination-dependent molecular switches that determine therapeutic resistance versus tumor elimination.
