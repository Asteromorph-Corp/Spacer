Nav1.7 and Nav1.8 channels function as intrinsic activity sensors in nociceptor terminals, where use-dependent slow inactivation creates molecular memory encoding recent firing history. This autonomous feedback mechanism exploits physiologically relevant recovery kinetics to establish self-limiting excitability control, offering therapeutic targets that restore endogenous regulation rather than symptom suppression.
