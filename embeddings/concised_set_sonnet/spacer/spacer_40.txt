Stress-induced glucocorticoids activate microglial mTOR/MAPK pathways to rapidly synthesize anti-inflammatory surface receptors through translational control, bypassing transcriptional programs. This mechanism enables microglia to simultaneously maintain inflammatory gene expression while remodeling neuroimmune interfaces within hours, creating a novel therapeutic target for stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders.
