HSP90 operates as a phosphorylation-controlled molecular switch, where distinct modification patterns create a "chaperone code" that dynamically toggles between protein folding and stress signaling functions. Phosphomimetic mutagenesis and kinetic modeling will demonstrate how combinatorial post-translational modifications reshape HSP90's conformational landscape, establishing chaperones as integrative regulatory hubs during cellular transitions.
