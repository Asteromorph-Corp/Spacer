Circadian NAD+ oscillations create temporal chromatin accessibility windows that transiently expose silenced neuroprotective genes, enabling precisely-timed metabolic interventions to amplify dormant stress-response programs by synchronizing NAD+ precursor delivery with endogenous chromatin relaxation phases for enhanced neurotherapeutic efficacy.
