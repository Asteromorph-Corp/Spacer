Dendritic compartments integrate synaptic computation and neuropeptide biosynthesis through shared calcium-dependent molecular machinery, where NMDA receptor signals simultaneously drive plasticity and activate local translation pathways. This creates unified computational-biosynthetic microdomains that directly convert specific neural activity patterns into proportional hormonal output, establishing a novel mechanism for real-time brain-body communication.
