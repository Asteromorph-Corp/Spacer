Ruthenium complexes engineered with tridentate ligands will selectively coordinate histidine clusters in the cardiac sodium channel DIII-DIV linker, exploiting metal-protein interactions to restore fast inactivation kinetics disrupted by doxorubicin-induced late sodium current, offering precision cardio-oncology therapeutics through tunable coordination chemistry.
