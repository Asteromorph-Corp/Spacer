Intronic G-quadruplex structures create physical barriers that redirect neuronal splice site selection by recruiting specific RNA-binding proteins and inducing polymerase pausing, with developmental helicase expression patterns creating disease-vulnerable windows where pathogenic quadruplex formation drives aberrant exon inclusion through altered spliceosome assembly dynamics.
