Oxidative stress simultaneously disrupts bacterial quorum sensing and host inflammatory regulation through predictable chemical modifications, creating cascading dysfunction that undermines microbial community coordination. This research maps interconnected oxidative damage patterns to identify therapeutic targets for restoring ecosystem-level resilience via quorum sensing rehabilitation.
