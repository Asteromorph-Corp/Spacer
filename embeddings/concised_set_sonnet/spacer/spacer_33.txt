Stress-induced glucocorticoid receptor activation creates persistent chromatin modifications at immediate early gene promoters, establishing elevated synaptic plasticity thresholds that trap fear circuits in inflexible configurations. This epigenetic constraint mechanism prevents extinction learning by blocking the dynamic gene expression required for inhibitory ensemble formation, offering personalized therapeutic targets based on individual chromatin states.
