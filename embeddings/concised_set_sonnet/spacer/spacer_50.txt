CRISPR-dCas9 chromatin modifier targeting will directly test whether enhancer accessibility changes causally drive T cell lineage specification by systematically perturbing pioneer factor-remodeled chromatin landscapes and measuring resulting transcriptional network changes through single-cell multiomics, definitively establishing mechanistic links between epigenetic state and immune cell fate determination.
