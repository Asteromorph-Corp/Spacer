Natural biofilms encode evolutionarily optimized quorum sensing crosstalk patterns that can be systematically mapped and reverse-engineered as blueprints for programming synthetic microbial consortia, leveraging millions of years of refined communication strategies to achieve predictable population dynamics without designing interactions from scratch.
