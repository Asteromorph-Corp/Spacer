FoxO transcription factors act as combinatorial post-translational switches that translate oxidative stress into discrete metabolic fates through bistable modification patterns, creating hysteretic regulatory modes that predictably toggle between antioxidant survival and apoptosis by reprogramming glycolytic-oxidative balance.
