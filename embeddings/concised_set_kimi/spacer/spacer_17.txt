Clustered epigenetic marks impose cumulative mechanical strain that tilts chromatinâ€™s free-energy landscape into bistable topologies, enabling density-dependent phase transitions between active and silent states. This strain-driven switch mechanism uniquely mechanizes epigenetic memory by linking modification density to cooperative structural bifurcations without requiring sequence-specific factors.
