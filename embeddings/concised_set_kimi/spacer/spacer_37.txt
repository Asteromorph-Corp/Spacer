Nociceptor terminals encode firing history through Nav1.7/1.8 channels that accumulate slow-inactivated states with 0.5–1.5 s memory, functioning as autonomous activity sensors whose high-density clustering autonomously gates subsequent excitability, creating self-limiting feedback that remains modifiable but operates without external input—a homeostatic regulator whose dysregulation drives pain channelopathies.
