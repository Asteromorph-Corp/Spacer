Oxidative stress simultaneously cripples bacterial LasR quorum sensing and host Nrf2 anti-inflammatory pathways through predictable hydroxylations that collapse N-acyl homoserine lactone signaling 18-fold, creating a unified redox failure cascade; exploiting these deterministic chemical transformations as precise intervention nodes restores microbial community coordination and inflammatory homeostasis.
