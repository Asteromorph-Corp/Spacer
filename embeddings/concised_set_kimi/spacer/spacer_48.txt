Injury-triggered cholesterol flux reshapes axonal lipid rafts, clustering TrkB receptors and rewriting calcium oscillations that encode steering commands for regenerating growth cones. By targeting cholesterol-TrkB interactions, we exploit hormonal control of membrane microdomains as a systemic lever to restore precise calcium choreography and accelerate neural repair.
