Matrix metalloproteinases unlock extracellular VEGF reservoirs, enabling hypoxia-independent angiogenesis through rapid proteolytic release. We exploit this mechanistic bypass by selective MMP targeting to trigger localized vascularization in HIF-1Î±-deficient ischemic tissues, distinguishing our precision approach from indiscriminate MMP inhibition strategies.
