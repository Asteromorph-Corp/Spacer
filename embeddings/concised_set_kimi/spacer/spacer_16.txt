Cytokine glycosylation remodels lipid rafts through lectin-glycan mechanochemical coupling, translating inflammatory signals into distinct membrane architectures; exploiting heterogeneous glycan patterns reveals how multivalent lectin interactions drive phase separation, mechanical stress evolution, and signal compartmentalization to control inflammatory outcomes.
