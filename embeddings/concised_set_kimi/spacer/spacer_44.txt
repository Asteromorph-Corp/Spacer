Circadian degradation of RNA-binding proteins gates stress-induced immune transcript decay; by selectively locking altered stability into epigenetic memory only when stress strikes discrete clock phases, cells encode time-stamped molecular memories that durably retune immune thresholds for circadian-dependent pathogen priming.
