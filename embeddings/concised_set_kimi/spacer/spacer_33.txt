Glucocorticoid receptor-driven chromatin states at immediate early genes entrench neural fear ensembles by raising synaptic plasticity thresholds through metabolite-locked histone acetylation feedback loops, creating extinction-resistant memory configurations that glucocorticoid blockade selectively dissolves via baseline epigenetic variability.
