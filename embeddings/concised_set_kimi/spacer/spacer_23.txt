Nuclear pores create chaperone-gated checkpoints where Hsp70-karyopherin coupling makes folding status the immediate arbiter of transport; by architecturally re-coupling these microdomains we can rejuvenate aging proteostasis, since restoring Gsp1-driven transport dynamics rescues both protein quality control and longevity.
