Anisotropic pores drive predictable neurotrophin gradients via differential diffusion, sculpting axonal trajectories for circuit reconstruction. Integrating gradient-generating scaffolds with anti-inflammatory delivery uniquely fuses biochemical guidance and permissive architecture to direct growth cone navigation and establish functional synaptic integration.
