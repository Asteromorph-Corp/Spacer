Competitive inhibition of cholesterol-sphingomyelin hydrogen bonding offers deterministic control of lipid raft stability below liquid-ordered phase thresholds, leveraging bulky sphingomyelin substitutions to create predictable dose-response relationships for controllable modulation of raft-dependent mechanotransduction while preserving membrane integrity.
