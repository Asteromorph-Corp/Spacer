Circadian NAD+ oscillations transiently unlock silenced neuroprotective genes through rhythmic HDAC modulation; precisely timing NAD+ precursor and metabolic co-stress delivery at these chromatin-relaxation peaks exploits endogenous clock machinery to amplify dormant neural defense programs while personalizing therapy via individual circadian metabolomic signatures.
