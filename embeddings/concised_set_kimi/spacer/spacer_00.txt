Mechanical conformational switching of Î±-actinin propagates asymmetric force through hierarchical actomyosin networks, amplifying local mechanosensitive triggers into polarized cell-scale deformations via nonlinear feedback loops that integrate molecular-scale conformational cascades into emergent contractile patterning.
