Mitochondrial-ER contacts act as lipid-gated calcium microdomains converting metabolic flux into regenerative transcription; by architecturally tuning phospholipid barriers we decode how membrane lipid stoichiometry sculpts compartmentalized calcium transients that translate systemic energy states into spatially-restricted transcriptional programs controlling regeneration.
