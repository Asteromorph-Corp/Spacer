MCU-captured presynaptic calcium fuels oxidative phosphorylation, sculpting nanoscale ATP microdomains that tune vesicle fusion kineticsâ€”creating a direct, millisecond metabolic throttle on synaptic release probability that distinguishes mitochondrial from glycolytic energetic control of neural timing precision.
