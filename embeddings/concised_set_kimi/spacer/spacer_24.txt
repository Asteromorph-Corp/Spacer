HSP90 phosphorylation orchestrates a molecular switchboard where discrete modification patterns rewire conformational landscapes, transforming this folding chaperone into a dynamic signaling integrator that synchronizes proteostasis reprogramming during cellular transitions through combinatorial post-translational "chaperone codes".
