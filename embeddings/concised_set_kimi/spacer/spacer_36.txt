Phosphorylation converts HDAC4 from constitutive repressor to Ca²⁺-gated switch: CaMKII targets S246 within its nuclear localization signal, triggering cytoplasmic sequestration and derepression of synaptic gene programs. This bidirectional shuttling distinguishes activity-triggered plasticity from baseline transcription, creating a selective therapeutic lever for neurodevelopmental disorders that spares brain architecture while modulating synaptic maturation.
