Disrupted astrocytic ion-channel choreography collapses neuron-glia slow-wave synchrony that mechanically drives glymphatic tau efflux; re-tuning selective conductances to restore membrane-potential oscillations realigns fluid-pulsing rhythms, offering a conductance-centric strategy to rescue proteostasis in Alzheimerâ€™s disease.
