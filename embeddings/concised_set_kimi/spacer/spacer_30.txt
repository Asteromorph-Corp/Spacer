Polymorphic AU-rich 3'UTRs encode tunable mRNA stability by differentially engaging the zinc-finger lattice of tristetraprolin and the cooperative oligomerization of HuR, allowing immune networks to transmute identical decay cues into context-specific cytokine output through graded binding preferences sculpted by natural sequence variation.
