Cells encode state decisions in hierarchically ordered ATP-allocation patterns; we predict transitions by modeling metabolic flux hierarchies constrained by thermodynamics, exploiting the insight that upstream energy flux limits downstream fate choicesâ€”a bioenergetic blueprint for cellular identity.
