Sequence-agnostic binding specificity emerges from universal spatial archetypes encoded in geometric curvature, void volume, and surface complementarity patterns that transcend chemical identity. By fusing these descriptors with physicochemical interaction metrics and training machine learning models on crystallographic and MD datasets, we identify conserved 3D templates predictive across all biomolecular complex classes.
