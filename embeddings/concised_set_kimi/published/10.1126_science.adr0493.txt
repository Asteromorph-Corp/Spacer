G-quadruplex regulation hinges on timing: we posit that ATM/ATR activation gates BRCA2-RAD51 invasion against DHX36-FANCJ unwinding through G-loop formation. By synchronizing single-molecule imaging with biochemical reconstitution, we will reveal how kinetic mismatch between assembly and disassembly creates distinct intermediates dictating transcriptome versus genome stability outcomes.
