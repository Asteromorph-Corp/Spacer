Exploiting a human MGE-interneuron xenograft model, we will test the hypothesis that subtype-specific maturation trajectories are programmable through targeted transcriptional regulators; accelerating SST/PV specification and synaptic integration promises to enhance seizure suppression and define the molecular rules governing GABAergic circuit assembly for precision regenerative therapy.
