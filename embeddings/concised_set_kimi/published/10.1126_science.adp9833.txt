Dopamine precision emerges from a dual-pathway decoder: membrane-locked Gβγ delivers rapid, nanodomain-restricted signals while cytosolic second messengers broadcast slower, diffuse waves across striatal dendrites. By mapping these spatiotemporally distinct D2 receptor responses to sparse dopamine release, we reveal how subcellular compartmentalization transforms diffuse neuromodulation into circuit-specific computation.
