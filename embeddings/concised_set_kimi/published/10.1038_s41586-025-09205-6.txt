Metabolic function imposes a hierarchical architecture of selective pressures on enzymes: catalytic-site geometry dominates structural conservation, biosynthetic cost becomes secondary, and surface residues evolve neutrally. By mapping predicted structures onto phylogenetic flux landscapes, we expose how metabolic niche specialization encodes predictable evolutionary trajectories across network hierarchies.
