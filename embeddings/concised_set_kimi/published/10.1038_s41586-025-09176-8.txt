Cancer-associated neurons directly seed metastasis by donating mitochondria, reprogramming recipient cells into hyper-resilient subclones; MitoTRACER lineage tracing plus metabolic profiling uniquely maps this neuronal mitochondrial trafficking as a druggable axis in nerve-driven metastatic progression.
