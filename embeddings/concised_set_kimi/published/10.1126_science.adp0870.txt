Synaptotagmin isoforms act as region-specific calcium rheostats: Syt1's high-affinity architecture secures cortical transmission at modest Ca²⁺, whereas Syt2's divergent kinetics tune subcortical circuits. Precision photolysis/electrophysiology deciphers this molecular tuning, revealing how protein structure evolution sculpts synaptic reliability across brain regions.
