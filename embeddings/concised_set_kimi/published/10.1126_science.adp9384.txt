Living insects become programmable nanocarbon foundries: their cytochrome P450 arrays execute regioselective Câ€“C bond oxyfunctionalizations on rigid belt and ring scaffolds, converting systemic xenobiotic metabolism into a scalable, tunable route for architecturally elusive nanocarbon derivatives unattainable by synthetic chemistry.
