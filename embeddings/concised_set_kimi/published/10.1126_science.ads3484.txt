Centromere function hinges not on sequence identity but on conserved architectural grammar: we exploit motif spacing, orientation, and higher-order patterning as universal structural signatures. Decoding these “centeny maps” across species and pathologies reveals evolutionary constraints and cryptic rearrangements invisible to sequence-centric assembly, reframing centromere biology through architecture rather than ancestry.
