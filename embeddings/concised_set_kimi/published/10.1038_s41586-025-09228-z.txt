We posit that epithelial serotonin acts as a molecular translator, converting luminal nutrients into discrete enteric neural codes through receptor-subtype-specific signaling cascades that orchestrate radial information flow from villus to submucosal plexus, enabling nutrient discrimination without direct neuronal chemosensing.
