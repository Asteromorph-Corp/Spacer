Temporal movement signatures encode cognitive states: stereotyped patterns lock neural dynamics into focused engagement while heightened variability paradoxically amplifies predictive model accuracy by reflecting disengagement. We manipulate these kinematic rhythms to causally steer neural encoding, revealing movement as the active architect—not passive echo—of distributed cognitive representations.
