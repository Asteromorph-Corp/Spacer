Neurodegeneration in CSF1R-haploinsufficient microgliopathy halts when wild-type microglia restore disrupted neuroprotective signaling, not merely reconstitute cell numbers. By transplanting CSF1R-normal microglia into staged CAMP-mutant mice, we dissect how precise restoration of phagocytic-inflammation pruning circuits rescues axonal integrity, defining the molecular rescue signature and therapeutic window unique to this microglial replacement paradigm.
