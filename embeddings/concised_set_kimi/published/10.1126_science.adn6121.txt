Sequential morphogen priming before transcription-factor induction cooperatively unlocks otherwise-inaccessible neural regulons, driving complete excitatory/inhibitory subtype diversity; multiplexed single-cell mapping of systematically varied timing combinations reveals how extrinsic-intrinsic coordination programs human neuronal fate.
