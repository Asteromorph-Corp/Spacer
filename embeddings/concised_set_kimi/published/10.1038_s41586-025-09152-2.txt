SP140 acts as a nuclear bodyâ€“localized molecular switch that compartmentally recruits either CCR4-NOT deadenylase to modulate interferon or chromatin silencers to silence viral genes; disrupting its dual SP140-RESIST-TTP axis will reveal how spatially organized effector recruitment coordinates antiviral and immune tuning pathways.
