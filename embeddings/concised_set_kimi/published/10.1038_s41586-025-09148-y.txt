We hypothesize that stepwise rewiring of thymic epithelial gene networks, traced through ancestral Foxn1 variants and divergent vertebrates, progressively expanded mimetic cell repertoires to match peripheral tissue innovation, revealing co-evolutionary checkpoints where thymic tolerance mechanisms scaled with vertebrate anatomical complexity.
