PTSD pathophysiology arises from orchestrated multi-cellular circuit failure in prefrontal cortex. Single-cell transcriptomics reveals how trauma propagates molecular disruptions across neurons, glia, and vasculature, creating glucocorticoid receptor dysregulation. This systems-level view explains PTSDâ€™s heterogeneous biology by tracing symptoms to emergent dysfunction within integrated cellular networks rather than isolated cell types.
