Hypothesis: conserved developmental programs orchestrate vasculature formation across organs. Strategy: apply vascular-inducing factors to micropatterned gastruloids, generating branched networks in cardiac versus hepatic organoids. Distinction: reveals universal principles of human vascularization inaccessible in vivo, testing whether shared signaling cascades or organ-specific programs dominate.
