AUX/IAA multimerization acts as a tunable redox rheostat: oxidative cysteine modifications trigger graded conformational switches that titrate co-repressor affinity, translating ROS intensity into calibrated auxin responses. Exploiting differential redox sensitivities across family members enables tissue-specific drought adaptation through stress-responsive transcriptional reprogramming.
