Mapping enzyme sequence-catalysis landscapes through high-throughput kinetic profiling of hundreds of orthologs and mutants, we leverage semisupervised machine learning that fuses experimental catalytic constants with protein language model embeddings to reveal how structural motifs partition catalytically heterogeneous neighborhoods, exposing new evolutionary rules for enzyme engineering.
