We posit that T6SS contact killing is a primary nutrient acquisition mode that orchestrates microbial ecosystems. By tracking single-cell lysis and isotope flux, we reveal how bacteria lacking biosynthetic genes outsource metabolism through programmed neighbor predation, converting antagonism into community-wide nutrient circulation.
