NRAS(Q61*) mutants drive melanoma but lack selective clinical agents, prompting investigation of alternative therapeutic targets within the RAS signaling network. SHOC2 operates as part of the SHOC2-MRAS-PP1C complex and exhibits dependency relationships with RAS(Q61*) tumors in a nucleotide-state-dependent manner across RAS isoforms. Oncogenic NRAS(Q61R) forms direct protein interactions with SHOC2, creating a neomorph complex that differs from canonical RAS signaling architecture. High-throughput screening identifies small molecules that specifically bind SHOC2 and disrupt its interaction with NRAS(Q61*), offering a mechanism to block this neomorphic protein complex. Structure-based optimization of these SHOC2-binding compounds produces cellularly active molecules that inhibit MAPK signaling and proliferation in RAS-mutant cancer models, particularly those harboring NRAS(Q61*) mutations.
