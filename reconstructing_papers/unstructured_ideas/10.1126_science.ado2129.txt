Diapause represents a seasonal adaptive strategy in insects where very few causal loci have been identified, creating an opportunity to understand the genetic basis of this timing mechanism. The N terminus of the clock protein CYCLE contains structural variations that could affect its functional properties in regulating developmental timing. Cross-mapping and genome-wide association analysis can identify major causal effectors by detecting genetic variants associated with diapause differences across silk moth strains. A specific deletion in polyvoltine strains may disrupt an alternative isoform of CYCLE, suggesting that different CYCLE isoforms contribute to functional diversity in modulating both circadian rhythms and diapause. This isoform-based mechanism could explain how adaptive phenotypes evolve rapidly without disrupting essential circadian functions, representing a novel framework where alternative protein variants enable evolutionary flexibility while preserving core biological processes.
