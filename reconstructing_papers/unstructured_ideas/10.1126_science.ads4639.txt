Prokaryotic defense-associated reverse transcriptases function as antiviral systems, yet their operational mechanisms lack detailed characterization. DRT9 assembles into a hexameric complex with its upstream non-coding RNA to establish antiphage defense through abortive infection pathways that arrest cellular growth. Phage-encoded ribonucleotide reductase NrdAB complex increases intracellular dATP concentrations during infection, which activates DRT9 to produce extended poly-A-rich single-stranded cDNA molecules. These cDNA products sequester essential phage SSB protein, thereby disrupting viral replication cycles. Cryo-electron microscopy structural analysis of the DRT9-ncRNA hexamer complex reveals the mechanistic basis underlying its cDNA synthesis activity, demonstrating how reverse transcriptase-based defense systems operate through nucleic acid interference rather than conventional degradation mechanisms.
