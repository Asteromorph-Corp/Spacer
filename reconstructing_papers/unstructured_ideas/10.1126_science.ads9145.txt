Preinvasive squamous lung lesions arise through unknown cellular events that precede lung squamous cell carcinoma development. Carcinogen exposure triggers non-neutral competition among basal cells, which possess the capacity for clonal expansion and mobilization along airways. A carcinogen-induced model without added genetic hits or cell type bias reveals how highly mutated clones can dominate the bronchial tree through aberrant expansion patterns. Multi-site sequencing demonstrates that clonally related preinvasive lesions can establish across distinct airway regions in human patients. The research concept focuses on identifying transitions in basal cell clonal dynamics and associated shifts in basal cell fate as the mechanistic drivers underlying field cancerization in lung tissue.
