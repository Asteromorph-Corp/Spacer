Glutamatergic neuronal activity promotes proliferation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells and gliomas, but the contribution of neuromodulatory brainstem circuits to diffuse midline glioma growth remains unknown. Midbrain cholinergic neurons from the pedunculopontine nucleus and laterodorsal tegmentum nucleus send long-range projections to midline structures where diffuse midline gliomas arise, suggesting these circuits could modulate tumor proliferation through acetylcholine release. The study proposes using optogenetic stimulation to selectively activate these distinct cholinergic populations and determine their circuit-specific effects on diffuse midline glioma growth. Co-culture systems will test direct cholinergic neuronal influence on diffuse midline glioma proliferation, while single-cell RNA sequencing will identify cholinergic receptors expressed by tumor cells. CHRM1 and CHRM3 muscarinic receptors represent candidate mediators of acetylcholine signaling in diffuse midline glioma cells. Pharmacological and genetic approaches targeting M1/M3 receptors will test whether cholinergic activity drives diffuse midline glioma proliferation through these specific receptor pathways, establishing whether activity-dependent tumor growth mirrors the known proliferative effects on healthy oligodendrocyte precursor cells.
