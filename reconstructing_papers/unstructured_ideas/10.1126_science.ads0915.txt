Mobile integrons capture and stockpile gene cassettes of unknown function whose adaptive value remains unexplored, creating an opportunity to investigate whether these elements encode previously unrecognized defense mechanisms. Bacteriophages exert strong selective pressure on bacterial populations, and the modular nature of integron cassettes allows for combinatorial assembly of resistance functions. The variable fitness costs of integron cassettes depend on genetic context and cassette order within arrays, suggesting that these elements could function as reconfigurable defense systems. Bacteriophage resistance integron cassettes can be combined with antimicrobial resistance cassettes to create multifunctional resistance platforms. Mobile integrons serve as vehicles that can rapidly disseminate these combined defense capabilities among bacterial populations, potentially acting as mobile defense islands with tunable costs.
