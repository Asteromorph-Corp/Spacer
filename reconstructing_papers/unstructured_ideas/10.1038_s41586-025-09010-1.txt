The human fetal cortex develops distinct molecular and structural characteristics across its six layers and multiple areas, but conventional single-cell transcriptomic approaches lose the spatial context essential for understanding how cellular organization emerges during development. MERFISH preserves spatial relationships while enabling single-cell resolution analysis of gene expression patterns, making it possible to track how molecular specification relates to physical positioning within developing cortical tissue. Deep-learning-based nucleus segmentation enhances the precision of cellular identification within the spatially preserved tissue architecture. The approach examines multiple cortical areas across developmental time points to capture how layer-specific excitatory neuron subtypes establish the characteristic laminar organization before cytoarchitectural features become apparent. The method specifically investigates cortical areal specification patterns, particularly focusing on the transition between primary visual cortex V1 and secondary visual cortex V2, where unique boundary formation mechanisms may differ from typical gradient-based arealization processes. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing integration with MERFISH data reveals the temporal dynamics of synaptogenesis regulation in layer-specific neuronal populations, connecting molecular programs to spatial cortical development.
