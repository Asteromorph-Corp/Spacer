Cognitive states naturally fluctuate during decision-making tasks, creating an opportunity to examine how these internal states relate to neural activity patterns and movement behaviors. Cortex-wide neural recordings during decision-making in mice can capture the relationship between cognitive engagement levels and neural encoding properties. A linear encoding model can quantify how well neural activity patterns explain behavioral variance across different cognitive states. Movement stereotypy serves as a measurable behavioral parameter that reflects cognitive engagement, where less stereotyped movements indicate disengagement while maintaining similar overall motion energy. The temporal structure of movement patterns provides an embodied signature that links cognitive state to neural activity, allowing examination of how task-independent movements and movement alignment relate to neural encoding strength and behavioral performance.
