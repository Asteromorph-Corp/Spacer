Ketamine produces rapid antidepressant effects through synaptic potentiation at CA3-CA1 synapses, but repeated treatment causes side effects that limit clinical utility. Dual-specificity phosphatases 6 normally terminate extracellular signal-regulated kinase activity, so pharmacological inhibition of DUSP6 should amplify and sustain ketamine-induced synaptic potentiation by prolonging ERK signaling. This approach targets the downstream intracellular signaling cascade rather than requiring repeated ketamine exposure, potentially extending antidepressant effects from a single ketamine administration. The concept relies on tropomyosin receptor kinase B in excitatory neurons to mediate the enhanced synaptic and behavioral responses, suggesting that selective modulation of this pathway could overcome the limitation of ketamine's transient therapeutic window.
