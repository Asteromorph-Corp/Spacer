Recognition of familiar individuals requires encoding their identities alongside social properties like sex and strain, yet how the brain integrates these multidimensional features into cohesive social memories remains unclear. The ventral CA1 region receives inputs from the dorsal CA2 region and medial amygdala, anatomical connections that position vCA1 to combine identity information with social attributes through dual neural coding mechanisms. Neurons in vCA1 can employ both rate coding and theta-based temporal coding to simultaneously represent individual identities and social properties of familiar conspecifics. Optogenetic reactivation of specific social memory engrams encoded in vCA1 neurons can test whether these memories carry differential valence based on the sex of the remembered individual. Selective ablation of upstream dorsal CA2 or medial amygdala regions can reveal their necessity for maintaining sex-specific social memory representations and valence differences in vCA1.
