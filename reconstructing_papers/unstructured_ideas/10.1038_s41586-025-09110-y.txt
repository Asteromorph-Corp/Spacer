Gregarious migratory locusts release 4-vinylanisole (4VA) as an aggregation pheromone that drives swarm formation, suggesting that disrupting its biosynthesis could control locust behavior without chemical pesticides. The biosynthetic pathway begins with phenylalanine from food plants and proceeds through cinnamic acid, p-hydroxycinnamic acid, and 4-vinylphenol (4VP) as precursors. The critical step involves methylation of 4VP to 4VA by two methyltransferases, 4VPMT1 and 4VPMT2, which occurs uniquely in gregarious locusts. X-ray co-crystal structure analysis of 4VPMT2 bound with 4VP and S-adenosyl-L-methionine reveals the molecular basis for this methylation reaction and guides the development of 4-nitrophenol as a substrate surrogate. Chemical inhibitors targeting the enzymatic activities of 4VPMT proteins can block 4VA production and suppress locust aggregative behavior by interfering with this essential methylation step.
