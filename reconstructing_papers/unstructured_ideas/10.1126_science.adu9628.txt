Cell shape changes during morphogenesis can serve as instructive cues that trigger asymmetric division and direct cellular identity decisions in tissue formation. Single-cell morphometric analyses of endothelial and mesenchymal-like cells reveal how distinct morphological changes switch cells to an isomorphic mode of division that preserves pre-mitotic morphology throughout mitosis. The preserved interphase morphology provides a geometric code that defines mitotic symmetry and fate determinant partitioning between daughter cells. Rab4-positive endosomes recognize this morphological code and respond by segregating determinants according to the pre-mitotic cell shape. This framework proposes that morphogenetic shape changes simultaneously sculpt tissue form and generate cellular heterogeneity through the geometric encoding of division patterns.
