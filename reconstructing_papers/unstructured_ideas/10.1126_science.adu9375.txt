Human pluripotent stem cells can be micropatterned into gastruloids that recapitulate early developmental processes, providing an alternative to studying embryonic vascularization in human embryos where ethical and technical constraints prevent direct observation. The earliest stages of cardiac and hepatic vascularization follow common developmental principles that can be triggered by applying specific vascular-inducing factors to these gastruloids. These factors exploit the intrinsic capacity of pluripotent stem cells to differentiate along vascular lineages while maintaining the spatial organization characteristic of organ-specific vascular networks. The same set of vascular-inducing factors can generate both cardiac vascularized organoids and hepatic vascularized organoids, suggesting that a conserved developmental program underlies vascularization across different organ types.
