Vascular dementia involves disrupted cell-cell interactions within white matter ischemic lesions that determine whether tissue undergoes progressive damage or repair. A VaD mouse model with focal ischemia reproduces the complex pathophysiology of human disease, enabling transcriptomic analysis of cell-type-specific responses alongside human VaD single-nucleus RNA sequencing data. Integration of these datasets with a custom ligand-receptor database containing thousands of interacting pairs identifies conserved dysregulated intercellular pathways between species. Two specific signaling systems emerge as disrupted in VaD: Serpine2-Lrp1 interactions that normally regulate oligodendrocyte progenitor cell differentiation, and CD39-A3AR signaling that maintains tissue integrity. The concept proposes that targeting these intercellular communication pathways through Serpine2 manipulation to enhance OPC repair capacity or A3AR agonism to restore tissue function represents a novel therapeutic approach for vascular dementia.
