The irreversible transition to superorganismal colony life in ants involved extensive genome rearrangements that correlate with speciation patterns, while conserved syntenic blocks containing co-expressed genes drive basal metabolism and caste differentiation processes. Gene families governing digestion, endocrine signaling, cuticular hydrocarbon synthesis, and chemoreception underwent expansion in the ant ancestor to support colonial functionality, and caste-associated genes experienced positive selection in the formicoid ancestor to refine social organization. Queen-worker dimorphism elaborations and reductions create convergent selection signatures in conserved signaling and metabolic pathways, indicating that a core gene set diversifies organizational complexity through intensified or relaxed selection pressures. Comparative genomic analysis across 163 ant species identifies previously uncharacterized genetic regulators of caste development, which functional experiments can validate to reconstruct how gene-regulatory networks integrate social traits and shape caste phenotypes.
