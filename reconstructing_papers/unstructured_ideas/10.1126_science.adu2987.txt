Current vision restoration technologies face clinical limitations that could be addressed by exploiting the unique optoelectronic properties of tellurium nanowire networks. TeNWNs possess narrow bandgaps and strong absorption characteristics that enable light-to-electrical signal conversion across both visible and near-infrared-II spectra, a capability enhanced through engineered asymmetries within the nanowire structure. This broad-spectrum photoresponsivity suggests that a subretinal nanoprosthesis incorporating TeNWNs could restore photosensitivity in damaged retinal tissue while simultaneously extending functional vision into the near-infrared range. The approach leverages the intrinsic semiconductor properties of tellurium nanowires to generate electrical stimulation that mimics natural photoreceptor function, with the nanowire network architecture providing the necessary interface between optical input and retinal neural circuits.
