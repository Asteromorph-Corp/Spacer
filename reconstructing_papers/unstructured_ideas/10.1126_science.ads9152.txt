Basal forebrain cholinergic neurons possess the capacity to dynamically alter their response patterns based on behavioral context, suggesting they could serve as modulators of sensory prioritization. These neurons project to olfactory bulb circuits where their axonal activity normally correlates with orofacial movements rather than passive odor detection. The research proposes to examine whether cholinergic feedback axons can shift from movement-correlated firing to odor-aligned responses when mice engage in olfactory tasks, testing the hypothesis that this neural flexibility represents a mechanism for context-dependent sensory modulation. The study leverages the modality-specific projection patterns of cholinergic neurons to dorsal cortex and olfactory bulb to determine whether response pattern shifts occur selectively within relevant sensory pathways. Cholinergic neuron inactivation would test whether this dynamic modulation directly influences olfactory bulb granule cell responses and behavioral performance in olfactory tasks.
