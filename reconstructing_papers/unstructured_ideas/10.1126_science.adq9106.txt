G protein–coupled receptor signaling regulation by different orthosteric ligands operates through shifts in dynamically interconverting, conformational distributions that require high-resolution detection methods to reveal their native structural behavior. The central, highly conserved xWIPF motif and contiguous regions separated by conserved prolines create distinct zones of rigid and loose conformational coupling that transmit signals through the receptor structure. Paramagnetic nuclear magnetic resonance enables assignment and tracking of 1H-15N NMR correlations in the β1-adrenergic receptor β1AR under ambient conditions to capture these conformational changes. The approach examines receptor responses to various orthosteric ligands in the absence or presence of a G protein–mimicking nanobody to reveal the dynamics and mechanism of signal transmission. The method exploits the plasticity of the intracellular face during transducer binding to map how conformational distributions shift throughout the receptor structure during signaling events.
