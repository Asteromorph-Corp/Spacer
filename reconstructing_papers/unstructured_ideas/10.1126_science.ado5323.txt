Marine heteroprokaryotes exhibit complex functional diversity that complicates efforts to quantitatively understand their role in global carbon cycling. This study proposes to integrate genetic sequencing data with a mechanistic marine ecosystem model to map heteroprokaryotic functional biogeography at a global scale. The approach incorporates heteroprokaryotic diversity into a trait-based model organized along two key axes: substrate lability, which determines the accessibility of organic matter for microbial consumption, and growth strategy, which reflects metabolic optimization patterns. Genetic sequences from three ocean transects enable the compilation of 21 heteroprokaryotic guilds, with each guild's degree of optimization for rapid growth measured as copiotrophy. The model evaluates how gradients in grazing pressure and substrate lability shape biogeographical distributions by testing data-model consistency across ocean basins.
