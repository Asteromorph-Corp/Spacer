The stalling decline in malaria deaths due to widespread Anopheles vector resistance to insecticides in long-lasting insecticide-treated nets creates a need for alternative transmission-blocking strategies. Antiparasitic compounds can be incorporated into LLINs to directly kill parasites during their mosquito-stage development, potentially preventing onward transmission even when insecticides lose efficacy against resistant vectors. An in vivo screen against mosquito stages of Plasmodium falciparum development across 81 compounds spanning 28 distinct modes of action can identify those active against early parasite stages in the mosquito midgut lumen. Medicinal chemistry optimization of top screening hits focuses on endochin-like quinolones that inhibit the P. falciparum cytochrome bc1 complex, since CytB represents a critical metabolic target during parasite development. Lead ELQ compounds targeting separate sites in CytB at Qo and Qi positions can be incorporated and extruded into bed net-like polyethylene films to achieve potent, long-lasting activity that remains stable in insecticide-resistant mosquitoes.
