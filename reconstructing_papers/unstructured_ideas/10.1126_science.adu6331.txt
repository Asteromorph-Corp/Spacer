Null space theory suggests that neurons generate spikes both to drive behavior and to counteract unwanted effects from other neurons through competitive mechanisms. Purkinje cells in the cerebellum each possess a distinct vector that determines how their spikes influence eye movement, with spikes from multiple P cells combining through superposition of their respective vectors. The population activity exhibits selective cancellation where spikes contributing perpendicular to the intended movement direction are eliminated from the motor output. Mossy fibers deliver motor command copies and movement goal information to the cerebellar circuit. Molecular layer interneurons process these mossy fiber inputs and transform them so the P cell population can predict the precise moment when ongoing movement should terminate upon reaching its target.
