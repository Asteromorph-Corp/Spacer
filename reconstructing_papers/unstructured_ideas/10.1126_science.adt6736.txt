The CRL4 CRBN E3 ubiquitin ligase can be reprogrammed by molecular glue degrader compounds to degrade specific neosubstrate proteins, with known neosubstrates sharing a Î²-hairpin G-loop recognition motif that defines targeting rules. Structure- and surface-based matchmaking algorithms can systematically mine the human proteome for CRBN-compatible G-loop proteins by identifying this motif and the newly discovered helical G-loop motif across protein structures. VAV1 represents a noncanonical neosubstrate that engages CRBN through molecular surface mimicry rather than conventional motif recognition, suggesting broader targeting possibilities. This computational approach expands the recognizable CRBN target space beyond traditional motif-based predictions and establishes a platform for developing next-generation molecular glue degraders that can reprogram CRL4 CRBN specificity toward previously challenging drug targets.
