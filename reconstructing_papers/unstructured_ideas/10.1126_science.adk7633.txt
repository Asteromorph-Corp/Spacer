The human gut microbiota contains unique glycosidases that metabolize dietary fiber through pathways absent in host tissues, creating an opportunity for targeted drug delivery that bypasses systemic exposure. GlycoCaging conjugates anti-inflammatory drugs to complex plant oligosaccharides, forming inactive prodrugs that circulate systemically without therapeutic effect until they reach the colon. The unique glycosidases of autochthonous gut bacteria selectively cleave these glycoconjugates, releasing active drug molecules precisely at sites of intestinal inflammation. This approach exploits the distinct metabolic capabilities of gut microbiota to achieve site-specific drug activation while avoiding off-target effects in other tissues.
