The mammalian cortex contains distinct cell types whose individual contributions to cortical processes require selective experimental access through cell-type-specific targeting tools. Transcriptomic and epigenomic cortical cell-type taxonomies from mouse and human provide the molecular foundation for identifying marker genes and putative enhancers that exhibit cell-type-restricted expression patterns. These cell-type-specific regulatory elements can drive selective transgene expression when incorporated into transgenic lines or when packaged into enhancer adeno-associated viruses that deliver genetic tools to targeted cell populations. The approach combines systematic mining of multi-omics cell-type taxonomies with scaled creation of both transgenic driver and reporter lines alongside extensive enhancer AAV vector libraries to achieve comprehensive coverage of cortical cell subclasses for experimental manipulation.
