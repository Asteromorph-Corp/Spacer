Integrons function as genetic systems that acquire, express, and shuffle gene cassettes, with sedentary integrons harboring hundreds of cassettes whose functions remain largely unknown. Small variants of known antiphage systems appear to be favored for inclusion in integrons due to their compact size, suggesting that size constraints drive the selection of miniaturized defense mechanisms. The pandemic Vibrio cholerae strain carries integron cassettes that encode novel antiphage functions with little similarity to previously known systems, indicating that integrons serve as repositories for diverse and unexplored defense mechanisms. These novel systems provide defense through distinctive mechanisms including cell lysis or growth arrest, revealing that integrons stabilize and maintain small antiphage systems that function as an untapped biobank of bacterial defense strategies.
