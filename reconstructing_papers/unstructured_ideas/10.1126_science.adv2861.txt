Zinc finger proteins represent the largest family of transcription factors, but the mechanism by which they activate gene expression lacks clarity. The protein complex Zincore, composed of QRICH1 and SEPHS1, functions as a ZNF-specific coregulator that binds to zinc finger domains through a distinctive recognition mechanism. ZFP91 serves as a model Zincore client that binds to the conserved promoter motif CTTTAAR, allowing investigation of the coregulator-transcription factor interaction. SEPHS1 contains an arginine clamp structure that specifically recognizes DNA-bound zinc finger domains, providing a mechanism that can accommodate different ZNFs while stabilizing their binding to cognate DNA motifs. This zinc finger domain recognition system proposes a novel framework for understanding how ZNF transcription factors achieve stable DNA binding and transcriptional regulation through protein complex formation.
