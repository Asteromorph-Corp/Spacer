The unclear phylogenetic placement of eukaryotes within Asgard archaea complicates understanding of early eukaryotic evolutionary history. Metagenome-assembled genomes from previously undocumented Asgard archaea lineages can expand phylogenetic diversity and enable more sophisticated phylogenomic analysis using multiple marker sets to resolve eukaryotic positioning relative to Heimdallarchaeia diversification. The chimeric nature of Njordarchaeales genomes, composed of both Asgard and TACK archaea sequences, may influence phylogenetic reconstruction and requires consideration when determining eukaryotic ancestry. Ancestral reconstruction and molecular dating of the expanded genomic dataset can infer the metabolic characteristics and temporal emergence of the last Asgard archaea and eukaryote common ancestor relative to the Great Oxidation Event. The H2-dependent acetogenic metabolism of this ancestor would provide evidence for the hydrogen hypothesis of eukaryogenesis, which proposes eukaryotic origin through fusion of a H2-consuming archaeal host with a H2-producing protomitochondrion.
