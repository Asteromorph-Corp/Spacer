The nucleolus functions as a multiphase liquid-like structure where ribosomal RNAs undergo sequential processing steps to form ribosomal subunits, yet the spatial coupling between rRNA maturation and nucleolar organization remains unclear due to limited tools for monitoring processing dynamics. Sequential rRNA maturation steps may drive the outward movement of rRNA through distinct nucleolar phases, suggesting that rRNA processing itself governs the layered architecture of this biomolecular condensate. Sequencing combined with imaging can spatiotemporally map rRNA processing events across nucleolar compartments to reveal this spatial segregation pattern. An engineered rDNA plasmid system can generate synthetic nucleoli in cells, allowing targeted disruption of specific processing steps to test whether SSU processing defects alter phase ordering and whether LSU precursors are required for outermost layer formation. This approach tests the concept that rRNA functions simultaneously as both architectural scaffold and processing substrate, with rRNA maturation serving as a programmable blueprint that directs the multiphase organization essential for ribosome assembly.
