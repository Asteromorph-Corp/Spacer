ATP synthesis occurs in mitochondria but the endoplasmic reticulum requires cytoplasmic ATP import to power protein folding and quality control processes. SLC35B1, originally classified within the nucleotide sugar transporter family, exhibits binding specificity for ATP and ADP rather than nucleotide sugars, suggesting its function as the endoplasmic reticulum ATP importer. The transporter executes strict ATP/ADP exchange with kinetics matching endoplasmic reticulum ATP import requirements. Cryogenic electron microscopy structures reveal that nucleotides undergo vertical repositioning up to approximately 6.5 Ã… during translocation while maintaining interactions with a flexible substrate-binding site. This stepwise ATP translocation mechanism represents a novel substrate translocation model distinct from established SLC transporter mechanisms.
