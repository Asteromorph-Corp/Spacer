Futility-induced behavioral transitions in larval zebrafish involve norepinephrine driving both fast excitation and delayed inhibition of behavior and circuit activity, creating a biphasic response pattern whose inhibitory component requires explanation. Norepinephrine's ability to trigger astroglial release of adenosine triphosphate provides a pathway for converting the initial excitatory signal into a delayed inhibitory response. The extracellular conversion of adenosine triphosphate into adenosine creates a secondary signaling cascade that can activate hindbrain neuronal adenosine receptors. This astroglial purinergic signaling axis offers a mechanism whereby astroglia function as active computational elements rather than passive support cells in neuromodulatory networks. The approach examines how neuron-glial interactions through this adenosine triphosphate-to-adenosine conversion pathway implement the delayed inhibitory arm of norepinephrine-mediated behavioral control during futility responses.
