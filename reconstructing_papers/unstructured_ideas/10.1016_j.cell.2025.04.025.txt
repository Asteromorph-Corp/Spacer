The amnion provides signaling, structural, and nutritional support during pregnancy, yet studying human amnion formation and function has been limited by the lack of accurate in vitro models. Embryonic stem cells can self-organize into complex 3D structures that recapitulate developmental processes, suggesting they could model extra-embryonic tissue development. The concept exploits embryonic stem cells' intrinsic capacity for self-organization to generate post-gastrulation amnioids that form amnion and yolk sac surrounded by extra-embryonic mesoderm, mimicking human amniotic sac development up to 4 weeks post-fertilization. This 3D model system enables investigation of GATA3's role in amniogenesis and the autoregulatory feedback loops governing amnion formation through extra-embryonic signals. The approach provides a reproducible and scalable platform for studying embryo-amnion interactions beyond gastrulation while offering opportunities for large-scale pharmacological and clinical studies.
