Dopamine participates in complex brain networks through interactions with other neuromodulators and intracellular signaling pathways, but existing methods cannot simultaneously detect multiple neurochemicals in vivo. A chemigenetic sensor combining cpHaloTag with chemical dyes and the GRAB strategy could exploit the far-red to near-infrared spectral range to achieve high sensitivity dopamine detection with subsecond kinetics. This HaloDA1.0 sensor would occupy a distinct spectral window that enables simultaneous use with green and red fluorescent neuromodulator sensors, calcium indicators, cyclic adenosine 5â€²-monophosphate sensors, and optogenetic tools for multiplex imaging across cultured neurons, brain slices, and behaving animals.
