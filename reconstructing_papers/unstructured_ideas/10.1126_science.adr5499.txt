Split intein-mediated protein splicing can reconstitute functional proteins from separate fragments, enabling researchers to exploit this natural mechanism for introducing modifications at specific sites within target proteins. Genetic code expansion allows incorporation of noncanonical amino acids during translation, providing access to chemical functionalities not present in the standard twenty amino acids. Endogenous protein tagging permits modification of native proteins without overexpression artifacts that could alter cellular behavior. The integration of these three approaches creates a platform where split inteins facilitate site-specific insertion of epitopes, protein-specific sequences, and noncanonical amino acids into cellular proteins through controlled protein splicing reactions. This technology targets endogenous proteins directly in their native cellular context, bypassing the need for protein overexpression while maintaining minimal cellular perturbation.
