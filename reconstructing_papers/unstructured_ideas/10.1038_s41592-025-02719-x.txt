Mass spectrometry proteomics faces a critical challenge in accurately assessing false discovery rate control because existing software tools employ distinct methods for reporting errors and many remain closed-source with poor documentation. Three prevalent validation methods exist for FDR control, with one being invalid, one providing only a lower bound, and one being valid but under-powered, resulting in limited community insight into actual control effectiveness, particularly for data-independent acquisition analyses. A theoretical framework for entrapment experiments enables rigorous characterization of different approaches by establishing the logical foundation for error assessment. This framework supports the development of a more powerful evaluation method that can be applied alongside existing techniques to assess current tools. The approach involves first validating the analysis in data-dependent acquisition setups where understanding is better established, then applying the method to data-independent acquisition data to determine whether DIA search tools consistently control FDR across different dataset types including single-cell datasets.
