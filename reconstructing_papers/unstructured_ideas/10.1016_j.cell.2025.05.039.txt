Sleep enhances growth hormone release through complex interactions between distinct hypothalamic neuronal populations, but the precise circuit mechanisms governing this relationship remain unclear. SST neurons in the arcuate nucleus can suppress GH release by inhibiting nearby GHRH neurons that normally stimulate hormone secretion, while periventricular SST neurons directly inhibit GH release through projections to the median eminence. The differential activity patterns of GHRH and SST neurons during REM versus NREM sleep states suggest that sleep-wake-dependent neural circuits coordinate GH release timing through opposing regulatory pathways. GH itself may influence sleep architecture by modulating locus coeruleus neuronal excitability, creating a feedback mechanism that links hormonal signaling to arousal states. This approach examines how sleep-specific neural activity patterns in hypothalamic circuits generate the bidirectional relationship between sleep and hormone regulation.
