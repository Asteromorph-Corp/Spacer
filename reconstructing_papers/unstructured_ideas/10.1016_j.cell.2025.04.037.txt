DNA exists in human cells as a cohesive gel packed with histones, RNA, and chromatin-associated proteins, where only a subset of the proteome has physical access at any moment to organize transcription, replication, and repair. A zero-distance photo-crosslinking approach can quantify proteins in direct contact with DNA in living cells by creating peptide-nucleotide crosslinks that pinpoint protein-DNA interfaces with single-amino-acid resolution. This method generates DNA interactomes containing over one thousand proteins with physical access to DNA, enabling quantitative comparisons between differentially treated human breast cancer cells to detect recruitment of transcription factors, DNA repair proteins, and fast-acting restrictors of chromatin accessibility. The approach provides hypothesis-free exploration of genomic regulation by directly mapping the dynamic protein landscape that contacts DNA in living systems.
