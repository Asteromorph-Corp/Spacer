Meiotic errors produce chromosomal abnormalities that cause pregnancy loss, but the genetic basis of euploid pregnancy loss remains unclear. Whole-genome sequencing of fetal samples and parental samples from trios affected by pregnancy loss can reveal the parental and meiotic origins of chromosomal abnormalities while enabling assessment of de novo mutations on homologous chromosomes from parents transmitting extra chromosomes. The timing of maternal mutations can be determined by dating them relative to sister chromatid formation in fetal oocytes, since mutations occurring before this process exhibit distinct patterns. Comparing the frequency of pathogenic small sequence variant genotypes between pregnancy loss cases and adult populations should reveal whether these variants contribute significantly to fetal loss, as de novo mutation rates alone may not explain the full spectrum of early pregnancy failure.
