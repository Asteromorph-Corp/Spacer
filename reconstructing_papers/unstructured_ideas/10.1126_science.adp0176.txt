Mammals exhibit varying capacities for ear pinna regeneration following damage, with some species like rabbits successfully regenerating tissue while others like mice fail to do so. The concept proposes that deficient retinoic acid production, specifically through inadequate expression of the rate-limiting enzyme Aldh1a2 and enhanced RA degradation, underlies regenerative failure in non-regenerating species. Single-cell and spatial transcriptomic analyses will compare regenerating and non-regenerating mammalian species to identify molecular differences during tissue recovery. The approach involves examining whether Aldh1a2 activation or direct RA supplementation can restore regenerative capacity in normally non-regenerating species. The study will investigate how evolutionary changes in Aldh1a2-linked regulatory elements have contributed to species differences in regenerative ability. Transgenic approaches will test whether introducing regulatory elements from regenerating species can enhance regeneration in non-regenerating species, establishing a direct genetic basis for regenerative evolution.
