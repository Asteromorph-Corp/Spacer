Human T cell lymphotropic virus type-1 subtype-C exhibits more aggressive disease characteristics than the prevalent HTLV-1 subtype-A, necessitating targeted preventative and therapeutic interventions through a humanized mouse model that can recapitulate the specific pathogenic features of HTLV-1c infection. The combination of tenofovir and dolutegravir leverages their established antiretroviral mechanisms to reduce viral transmission and slow disease progression at clinically relevant doses. Single-cell RNA sequencing and intracellular flow cytometry reveal that HTLV-1c infection specifically dysregulates intrinsic apoptosis pathways in infected cells, creating a therapeutic vulnerability that can be exploited through targeted intervention. MCL-1's unique role in maintaining survival of HTLV-1c-infected cells, distinct from other anti-apoptotic proteins BCL-2, BCL-XL, and BCL-w, enables selective elimination of infected cells through BH3 mimetic compounds that specifically antagonize MCL-1 function. The conceptual framework combines conventional antiretroviral suppression with targeted apoptosis induction, utilizing the virus-induced apoptotic dysregulation as a therapeutic target to achieve enhanced efficacy against HTLV-1c infection.
