Medial ganglionic eminence-derived inhibitory Î³-aminobutyric acid pallial interneurons function as essential regulators of cortical circuits whose dysfunction associates with neurological disorders including drug-resistant epilepsy. Human pluripotent stem cells can differentiate into MGE-pINs that develop into somatostatin and parvalbumin subtypes when xenografted into host mice, recapitulating the natural progression through distinct transcriptional states involving neuronal migration, synapse organization, and membrane maturation. Single-nuclei RNA sequencing enables comparative transcriptomics against endogenous human brain datasets to verify that transplanted hMGE-pINs acquire authentic molecular signatures of diverse SST and PVALB subtypes. The temporal analysis of grafted cells in both healthy and epileptic environments reveals how hMGE-pINs mature across the host lifespan while maintaining subclass-specific features that mirror human cortical interneuron development.
