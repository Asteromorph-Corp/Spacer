Striatal neurons exhibit distinct molecular signatures that can be exploited through enhancer sequences to achieve selective targeting across different cell populations. An enhancer-AAV toolbox leverages cell-type-specific enhancers to drive transgene expression selectively in medium spiny neurons, direct- and indirect-pathway MSNs, Sst-Chodl interneurons, Pvalb-Pthlh interneurons, and cholinergic interneurons within striatal circuits. The approach combines enhancer specificity with AAV delivery to enable optogenetic perturbation of direct pathway circuits and multiplex labeling strategies for simultaneous visualization of multiple striatal interneuron populations. Cross-species validation demonstrates that MSN enhancers maintain their cell-type specificity across mammals, allowing the same vectors to function in rats and macaques beyond their initial mouse optimization.
