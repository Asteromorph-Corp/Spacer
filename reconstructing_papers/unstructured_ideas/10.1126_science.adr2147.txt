Ancient Borrelia recurrentis genomes from archaeological samples spanning 2300 to 600 years ago can provide direct temporal evidence for when this louse-borne pathogen diverged from its tick-borne relatives, as their preserved DNA retains the evolutionary signatures of vector specialization and genome reduction that characterize host-vector transitions. The unique property of ancient DNA to capture snapshots of pathogen evolution at specific historical moments allows phylogenetic analysis to precisely date the emergence of B. recurrentis relative to its closest tick-borne ancestor. Pan-genome analysis of these temporally stratified ancient genomes can reveal the chronological sequence of gene loss and plasmid evolution that accompanied the transition from tick-borne to louse-borne transmission. This approach leverages the differential preservation of genetic material across archaeological time periods to reconstruct the evolutionary timeline of vector specialization in a human pathogen.
