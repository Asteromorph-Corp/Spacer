Mice learn to associate optogenetic activation of striatum-projecting neurons in visual cortex with food pellet availability during forelimb reaching tasks. The striatum encodes both sensory context and reaching outcomes, positioning it as a critical hub for forming sensory-motor associations. Brief optogenetic inhibition serves as a tool to selectively disrupt striatal activity during different phases of learning and memory consolidation. This manipulation targets the specific temporal window when trial-to-trial improvements occur, distinguishing between active learning processes and already-consolidated memories. The approach leverages the striatum's dual encoding capacity to test whether its activity drives immediate performance improvements or affects retrieval of established motor memories.
