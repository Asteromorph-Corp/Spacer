The plasmid-encoded virulence gene pla exists in multiple copies on the pPCP1 plasmid in Yersinia pestis, where higher pla dosage drives increased mortality in bubonic plague through enhanced virulence. Ancient strains from historical pandemics underwent pla depletion through a chromosomal rearrangement where pPCP1 integrates into the single-copy pCD1 plasmid, effectively reducing overall pla gene dosage while maintaining the gene's presence. This depletion specifically reduces lethality in bubonic plague models while leaving pneumonic and septicemic plague virulence intact, suggesting that the rearrangement represents an adaptive response to rodent population fragmentation. Modern Y. pestis strains independently acquired identical pla depletion events, providing a natural experiment to test whether reduced virulence in bubonic plague confers selective advantages when reservoir host populations become fragmented following pandemic-induced mortality.
