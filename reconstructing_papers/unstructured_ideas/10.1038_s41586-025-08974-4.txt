Iron catalyses the oxidation of lipids in biological membranes and promotes ferroptosis, but the precise subcellular location where this chemistry occurs remains undefined, limiting the design of spatiotemporally controlled interventions. The ferroptosis inhibitor liproxstatin-1 and inducer RSL3 both target lysosomal iron to respectively prevent or initiate membrane lipid oxidation, suggesting lysosomes as the primary site of ferroptotic chemistry. This lysosomal iron reactivity can be exploited by designing small-molecule activators that specifically trigger oxidative degradation of phospholipids within this organelle to induce ferroptosis. Iron-rich CD44high primary sarcoma and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells present an attractive target because their elevated iron content simultaneously drives cell adaptation and creates vulnerability to ferroptosis-inducing agents. The approach involves creating phospholipid degraders that control iron reactivity in lysosomes to selectively eliminate drug-tolerant persister cancer cells by forcing them into ferroptotic cell death.
