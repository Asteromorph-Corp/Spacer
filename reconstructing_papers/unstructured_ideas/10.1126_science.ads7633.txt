Navigating axons must solve the complex problem of selecting correct postsynaptic partners within three-dimensional space, which this study addresses by proposing that the 3D glomerular map of the fly antennal lobe emerges through serial dimensional reduction to 1D projections. The spherical surface of the antennal lobe serves as an initial contact zone where olfactory receptor neuron axons encounter projection neuron dendrites before final glomerular positioning occurs. Each ORN type follows a distinctive arc-shaped trajectory along this 2D surface that creates precise intersections with their specific partner dendrites. The research tests whether manipulating these axon trajectories disrupts synaptic partner matching, thereby examining how dimensional reduction from 3D to 1D search space simplifies the partner selection process.
