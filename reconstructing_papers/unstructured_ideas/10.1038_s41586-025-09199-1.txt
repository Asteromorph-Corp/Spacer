The brain's representation of sensory variables through coordinated neural population activity, where single neuron tuning curves define population code geometry, suggests that dynamic cognitive variables might follow the same coding principle despite unfolding through irregular spiking patterns in heterogeneous populations during internal processes. An approach simultaneously inferring population dynamics and individual neuron tuning functions to population states can reveal whether premotor cortex populations encode shared dynamic variables during choice formation. This method applied to decision-making spike data tests whether heterogeneous firing rates arise from diverse single neuron tuning to a common decision variable rather than fundamentally different encoding mechanisms. The population state dynamics can indicate whether an attractor mechanism underlies decision computation, potentially establishing a unifying geometric principle connecting sensory and dynamic cognitive variable encoding across different neural processes.
