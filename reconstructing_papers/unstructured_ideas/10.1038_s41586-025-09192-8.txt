Shotgun-sequencing data from ancient humans contains preserved DNA fragments from bacterial, viral and parasite species that infected these individuals during their lifetimes, creating an opportunity to map pathogen presence across time and space. The approach involves screening this archaeogenetic data to identify microbial DNA hits and grouping the detected species according to their reservoir types and transmission modes to reveal temporal patterns. Zoonotic pathogens, which require animal hosts before jumping to humans, should appear in the archaeological record only after livestock domestication events that brought humans into closer contact with potential animal reservoirs. The unique conceptual framework links pathogen reservoir ecology to major cultural transitions by using the temporal distribution of different pathogen types as indicators of changing human-animal relationships and migration patterns across Eurasian populations.
