Human telomerase ribonucleoprotein exists in both monomeric and dimeric forms, with the dimeric structure remaining poorly understood despite evidence for its biological relevance. The H/ACA RNP component of telomerase provides a structural framework that could mediate protein-protein interactions between telomerase complexes, potentially enabling dimer formation through direct contact between H/ACA domains from separate ribonucleoprotein units. Cryo-EM can capture high-resolution structural information of large protein complexes bound to their DNA substrates, allowing visualization of telomerase dimers in their active state with telomeric DNA. The spatial organization of subunits within the dimeric assembly reveals how H/ACA RNP domains create the dimerization interface, while the positioning of premature aging disease mutations at this interface suggests that dimer integrity affects telomerase function. This structural approach connects the molecular architecture of telomerase dimerization to its role in ribonucleoprotein assembly and cellular telomere maintenance.
