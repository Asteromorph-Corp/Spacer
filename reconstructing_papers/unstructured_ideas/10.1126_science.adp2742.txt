Oncogenic BRAF mutations drive tumor growth through uncontrolled RAS-ERK pathway activation by disrupting the normal autoinhibition mechanisms that regulate wild-type BRAF kinase activity. Wild-type BRAF maintains an autoinhibited state through specific interactions between its cysteine-rich domain and kinase domain, but oncogenic mutants including V600E evade this regulatory control through unknown structural mechanisms. The concept leverages cryo-electron microscopy to determine three-dimensional structures of all three oncogenic BRAF mutant classes, revealing how these mutations disrupt the autoinhibited conformation and shift the kinase domain into a preactivated state. The structural analysis focuses on helix αC displacement as the key mechanism underlying this conformational change. The approach tests whether PLX8394, a BRAF inhibitor that specifically stabilizes helix αC in an inactive conformation, can restore the autoinhibited state of oncogenic BRAF variants, providing structural insight into this compound class's therapeutic mechanism.
