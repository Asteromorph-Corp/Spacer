The type VI secretion system enables bacteria to overcome nutrient-limited growth by lysing neighboring cells through contact-dependent antagonism, converting cellular contents from target bacteria into accessible nutrients for the attacking organism. Single-cell live imaging combined with isotopic markers can track this nutrient transfer process during starvation conditions, revealing how the T6SS functions as a feeding mechanism rather than merely a competitive weapon. Genomic analysis of antagonistic bacteria demonstrates metabolic gene repertoire reduction, suggesting evolutionary adaptation toward reliance on nutrients obtained through lysis rather than biosynthesis. The widespread distribution of T6SS across bacterial taxa in natural environments indicates that this contact-dependent lysis mechanism may represent a fundamental nutrient acquisition strategy within microbial communities.
