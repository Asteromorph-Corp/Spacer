DNA methylation patterns at CpG sites contain two distinct information layers: one subset reflects cellular differentiation states while another undergoes stochastic epimutations that function as digital barcodes for clonal identity. EPI-Clone leverages targeted single-cell profiling of DNA methylation at single-CpG resolution to extract both differentiation and clonal information simultaneously, enabling transgene-free lineage tracing at scale. The method applies this dual-information approach to track stem cell clones through differentiation by reading the stochastic epimutation patterns that accumulate independently of the differentiation-linked methylation changes. Single-cell DNA methylation profiling captures clonal differentiation trajectories across large numbers of cells and individuals, providing a framework that circumvents the limitations of genetic engineering or sparse somatic DNA variants used in current lineage tracing approaches.
