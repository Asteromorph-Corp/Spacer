Adenylate kinase orthologs and mutants exhibit diverse catalytic constants that form mappable sequence-catalysis landscapes, yet traditional approaches cannot efficiently measure kcat and KM across hundreds of enzyme variants to reveal the quantitative relationships between sequence variation and catalytic function. Microfluidic technology enables high-throughput measurement of these catalytic parameters across diverse adenylate kinase sequences, allowing systematic dissection of how sequence changes influence enzyme performance. The sequence-catalysis landscape topology can be analyzed to understand the navigability between different catalytic states and the mechanistic underpinnings that organize enzyme variants into neighborhoods based on domain architecture. Large protein language models generate rich sequence representations that capture evolutionary and structural information, and when these representations are combined with experimental catalytic data in semisupervised models, they can predict orthologous adenylate kinase catalytic parameters more accurately than existing computational approaches.
