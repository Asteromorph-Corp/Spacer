Natural killer cells employ inhibitory and activating immune receptors to distinguish human cells from pathogens, with killer immunoglobulin-like receptors existing as pairs that share nearly identical extracellular ligand-binding domains but possess different intracellular signalling domains. RIFIN proteins displayed on Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocyte surfaces can bind inhibitory immune receptors to suppress NK cell activation, yet no pathogen-derived ligand has been identified for human activating receptors. This study investigates a clade of RIFINs that bind more strongly to inhibitory receptor KIR2DL1 than its natural human MHC class I ligand, exploiting the conserved binding surface shared between KIR2DL1 and its cognate activating receptor KIR2DS1. The research examines how these high-affinity RIFIN-KIR2DL1 interactions that mediate inhibitory signalling can simultaneously engage KIR2DS1 due to the structural similarity between the receptor pair, potentially activating rather than suppressing NK cells. The approach leverages the dual binding capacity of specific RIFINs to reveal how activating killer immunoglobulin-like receptors might recruit NK cells against pathogens through molecular mimicry of inhibitory receptor engagement.
