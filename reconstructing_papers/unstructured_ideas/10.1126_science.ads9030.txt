Translation termination requires peptide release factors to catalyze hydrolysis of peptidyl-tRNA at stop codons, and the conventional assumption posits that these factors activate a water molecule for nucleophilic attack. The peptidyl transferase center of bacterial ribosomes complexed with peptidyl-tRNA and peptide release factors can be structurally captured in the prepeptide release state to reveal the actual catalytic mechanism. Peptidyl-tRNA adenine 76 ribose exhibits conformational flexibility that allows peptide release factors to induce specific pucker rearrangements. The 2â€²-OH group of the A76 ribose can be repositioned through these conformational changes to directly attack the carbonyl group without requiring water molecule activation, suggesting an intramolecular nucleophilic mechanism rather than the conventionally proposed intermolecular hydrolysis.
