Auxin establishes asymmetric spatiotemporal distribution patterns that orchestrate plant growth and development through local gradients regulated by cellular influx and efflux mechanisms. AUX1/LAX family transporters function as major auxin influx carriers, with AUX1 from Arabidopsis thaliana serving as the primary uptake mediator whose molecular architecture remains uncharacterized. Cryo-EM structural determination captures AUX1 in auxin-unbound, indole-3-acetic acid-bound, and 3-chloro-4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid-bound states to reveal the transporter's inward-facing conformation across all conditions. The auxin-binding mechanism involves hydrogen bond coordination between indole-3-acetic acid's carboxyl group and specific AUX1 residues, while 3-chloro-4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid occupies the identical binding site as a competitive inhibitor. Functional validation through in vitro and in planta analyses confirms the structural predictions by testing key residue contributions to indole-3-acetic acid binding affinity and transport activity.
