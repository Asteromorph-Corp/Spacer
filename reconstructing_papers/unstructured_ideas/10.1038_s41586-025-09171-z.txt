Pentaploid dogroses achieve sexual reproduction despite polyploid chromosome pairing complications by forming bivalents with 14 chromosomes while maintaining 21 chromosomes as maternally inherited univalents. Haplotype-resolved chromosome-level genome assemblies enable subgenome phasing to identify which chromosome sets form bivalents versus univalents based on homology relationships. The bivalent-forming subgenome contains two highly homozygous chromosome sets while three divergent subgenomes lack homologous partners, determining their distinct meiotic behaviors. Comparative analyses of chromosome synteny and phylogenetic relationships trace subgenome origins to two divergent clades of Rosa, with pollen genome analysis revealing that subgenomes from different evolutionary origins can form bivalents. Centromere composition analysis examines structural differences between bivalent-forming and univalent chromosomes, where bivalent-forming centromeres show enrichment of ATHILA retrotransposons while univalent centromeres contain larger tandem-repeat-based structures. This centromere structural bimodality potentially drives the asymmetrical inheritance pattern during female meiosis in dogroses.
