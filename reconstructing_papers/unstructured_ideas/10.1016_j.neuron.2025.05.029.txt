Dendrites shape single-neuron computations in neocortical GABAergic interneurons through subtype-specific strategies that exploit distinct molecular and anatomical properties. SST-expressing cells utilize NMDAR-dependent supralinear integration combined with uniform synaptic distribution along their dendrites, where NMDARs enable broader temporal integration that supports sustained activity responses to slower input variations. PV-expressing cells employ sublinear integration with proximally biased synaptic inputs on dendrites that express low levels of NMDARs, allowing passive integration mechanisms to enable precise tracking of fast-changing signals. Compartmental modeling reveals how these contrasting dendritic integration strategies differentially enhance synaptic efficacy while producing distinct temporal response profiles. The approach tests whether NMDAR-mediated versus passive integration mechanisms, when coupled with specific synaptic distribution patterns, generate the predicted differential dynamic responses to visual stimuli that distinguish PV-INs from SST-INs in vivo.
