The melanocortin system regulates energy homeostasis through melanocortin-4 receptor and adenylyl cyclase 3 in neuronal primary cilia, but how melanocortin signaling functions within cilia remains unclear. G protein–coupled receptor 45 localizes to cilia in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus and recruits Gα s to increase ciliary cyclic adenosine monophosphate via adenylyl cyclase 3. GPR45 colocalizes with melanocortin-4 receptor in these cilia and promotes ciliary melanocortin-4 receptor activation, suggesting it bridges melanocortin-4 receptor and adenylyl cyclase 3 function. Mouse random germline mutagenesis can identify missense mutations in GPR45 that disrupt this ciliary signaling mechanism, while targeted loss of GPR45 in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus or melanocortin-4 receptor neurons tests its regulatory role in the ciliary melanocortin system.
