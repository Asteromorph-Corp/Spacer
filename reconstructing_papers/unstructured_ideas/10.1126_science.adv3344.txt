Retrons are antiphage defense systems that produce multicopy single-stranded DNA (msDNA), yet their defense mechanisms remain unclear. The Retron-Septu system uniquely integrates retron and Septu antiphage defenses into a single system. This system forms asymmetric nucleoprotein complexes comprising a reverse transcriptase (RT), msDNA (a hybrid of msdDNA and msrRNA), and two PtuAB copies, where msdDNA and msrRNA are essential for complex assembly. The msrRNA adopts a conserved lariat-like structure that regulates reverse transcription within the complex. The assembled Retron-Septu complex remains inactive because msdDNA occupies the PtuA DNA-binding site, preventing PtuAB function. Upon complex disassembly, PtuAB is released and degrades single-stranded DNA to restrict phage replication through this arrest-and-release mechanism.
