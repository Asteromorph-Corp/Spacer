Translation of the noncoding genome in cancer generates cryptic peptides that can be presented by human leukocyte antigen class I, yet the cancer specificity and immunogenicity of these noncanonical HLA-I-bound peptides remain poorly characterized. High-resolution immunopeptidomics can identify and quantify the complete repertoire of cryptic peptides within the pancreatic cancer immunopeptidome to determine which exhibit cancer-restricted translation patterns. An ex vivo T cell priming platform can assess the immunogenic potential of cancer-restricted noncanonical HLA-I-bound peptides by measuring their ability to activate cytotoxic T cell responses. T cell receptor-redirected T cells targeting these cryptic antigens can be tested against patient-derived pancreatic cancer organoids to evaluate their tumoricidal capacity, thereby establishing whether noncanonical peptides represent viable therapeutic targets for pancreatic cancer treatment.
