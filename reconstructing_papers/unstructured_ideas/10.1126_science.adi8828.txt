Type I interferon responses that protect against viral infection simultaneously inhibit epithelial cell proliferation, creating a fundamental tension between antiviral immunity and tissue repair in the lung. Macrophage-derived oncostatin M emerges as a potential mediator because this growth factor can specifically counteract the growth-inhibitory effects of type I interferon on alveolar type II epithelial cells. The research concept exploits OSM's unique ability to promote epithelial proliferation even in the presence of active type I interferon signaling, testing whether macrophage production of OSM represents a critical mechanism for maintaining lung epithelial homeostasis during viral challenge. The approach involves examining OSM-deficient mice under influenza infection and viral mimic challenge to determine whether loss of this growth factor leads to unchecked type I interferon responses and compromised epithelial barrier function. The study further tests OSM delivery as a therapeutic intervention and uses organoid formation assays to demonstrate OSM's capacity to overcome type I interferon-mediated growth inhibition in controlled conditions.
