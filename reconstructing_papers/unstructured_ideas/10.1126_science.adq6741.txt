Jaundice in Plasmodium falciparum malaria results from bilirubin accumulation, yet its role as an adaptive or maladaptive response remains unclear. The higher ratio of unconjugated over conjugated bilirubin in asymptomatic versus symptomatic infections suggests unconjugated bilirubin may confer protection against parasite proliferation. This concept proposes manipulating bilirubin metabolism through genetic suppression of biliverdin reductase A to reduce bilirubin synthesis and genetic inhibition of UDP glucuronosyltransferase family 1 member A1 to block hepatic conjugation, thereby increasing unconjugated bilirubin levels. The approach exploits unconjugated bilirubin's dual mechanism of suppressing mitochondrial pyrimidine synthesis in infected red blood cells and inhibiting hemozoin crystallization in the parasite's food vacuole. This framework tests whether elevated unconjugated bilirubin represents a metabolic defense mechanism that naturally limits malaria severity through direct interference with parasite cellular processes.
