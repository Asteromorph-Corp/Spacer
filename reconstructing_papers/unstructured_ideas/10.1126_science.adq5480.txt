Locus ceruleus-derived norepinephrine modulates synaptic function through a pathway that bypasses direct neuronal receptor engagement and instead operates via astrocytic adrenergic receptors, whose activation triggers calcium dynamics within astrocytes. These astrocytic calcium responses control the release of adenosine 5â€²-triphosphate, which subsequently acts on A1 adenosine receptors to suppress presynaptic efficacy. The proposal investigates this astrocyte-mediated mechanism as the primary route through which norepinephrine reconfigures circuit functional connectivity, positioning astrocytes as the central effector cells that translate neuromodulatory signals into synaptic modifications.
