Sleep deprivation triggers homeostatic mechanisms that generate recovery sleep, yet the specific neuronal circuits underlying this compensatory process remain unclear. Thalamic nucleus reuniens neurons become activated during sleep deprivation and exhibit the unique property of inducing presleep behaviors followed by prolonged, intense sleep when optogenetically stimulated, mimicking the characteristics of natural recovery sleep. These nucleus reuniens neurons function upstream of sleep-promoting zona incerta cells, forming a hierarchical circuit where sleep deprivation strengthens the synaptic connectivity between these populations through induced plasticity. The concept leverages optogenetic manipulation to dissect how sleep need accumulation transforms the functional coupling within this thalamic-zona incerta pathway, providing a circuit-based framework for understanding sleep homeostasis.
