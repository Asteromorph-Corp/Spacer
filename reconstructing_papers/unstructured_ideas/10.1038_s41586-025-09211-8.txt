Multi-omics studies using connectomes and spatial transcriptomes now achieve single-cell resolution, creating a need for reference brain atlases that can spatially localize individual cells. Nissl-based cytoarchitecture provides cellular-level structural detail when captured through continuous micro-optical sectioning tomography at isotropic 1-Î¼m resolution, enabling complete three-dimensional reconstruction of brain tissue. Multi-modal image integration allows construction of comprehensive three-dimensional reference atlases that map hundreds of distinct brain structures and generate slice images at any orientation with micrometer precision. An informatics-based platform processes these high-resolution atlas images to provide brain slice registration, neuronal circuit mapping, and stereotaxic surgery planning by leveraging the spatial precision inherent in the tomographic data. Cross-atlas navigation systems enable seamless integration with existing stereotaxic atlases by mapping corresponding anatomical planes across different coordinate systems and dimensional representations.
