Protein function depends on dynamic structural ensembles rather than static conformations, yet predicting functionally relevant structure changes remains computationally prohibitive due to the extensive timescales required for molecular dynamics simulations. BioEmu exploits deep learning to emulate protein equilibrium ensembles by integrating over 200 milliseconds of molecular dynamics simulations with static structures and experimental protein stabilities through novel training algorithms. The system generates thousands of statistically independent structures per hour on a single GPU, capturing diverse functional motions including cryptic pocket formation, local unfolding, and domain rearrangements while simultaneously predicting relative free energies. BioEmu jointly models structural ensembles and thermodynamic properties to provide mechanistic insights, amortizing the computational cost of molecular dynamics and experimental data generation for scalable protein function prediction.
