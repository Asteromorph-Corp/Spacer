Birds consume acidic fruits despite sourness being aversive to mammals, suggesting an evolutionary adaptation in avian taste perception. The sour receptor otopetrin 1 (OTOP1) undergoes acid-induced inhibition in birds, which differs from mammalian responses and potentially enables sour tolerance. Examining OTOP1 modulation across bird species can reveal how changes to this receptor affect sour perception mechanisms. Ancestral reconstruction of OTOP1 evolution alongside sweet sensing capabilities in songbirds can illuminate whether these taste modifications occurred simultaneously during songbird phylogenetic diversification. This approach tests whether coordinated changes in both sour and sweet taste receptors created broader fruit consumption abilities that influenced songbird evolutionary radiation.
