Natural signaling proteins undergo controlled conformational changes between distinct intradomain geometries that function as switch mechanisms, but deep learning approaches have only succeeded in designing static protein structures. Deep learning-guided design can be extended to engineer dynamic changes between specific protein conformations by predicting and controlling the conformational landscape with atomic-level precision. The approach involves designing proteins that transition between predetermined intradomain geometries, incorporating the capacity for orthosteric ligands to modulate these conformational states and for allosteric mutations to alter the switching behavior. Physics-based simulations provide validation of the deep learning predictions by confirming the designed conformational dynamics. This framework enables de novo construction of proteins with tunable conformational switches that mimic the dynamic signaling mechanisms found in natural proteins.
