Mitochondrial redox homeostasis relies on intrinsic antioxidant defenses, but the role of extrinsic mechanisms from other organelles remains unclear. ACBD5 and PTPIP51 proteins can form direct contacts between peroxisomes and mitochondria, creating potential pathways for interorganellar communication. The peroxisome's inherent capacity for ROS detoxification could be leveraged to support mitochondrial antioxidant defense if ROS transfer occurs across these contact sites. This study proposes to investigate whether peroxisomes directly maintain mitochondrial redox homeostasis through contact-mediated ROS transfer from mitochondria to peroxisome lumen. The approach involves examining how ACBD5-PTPIP51-mediated contacts respond to mitochondrial oxidative stress and testing whether these contacts facilitate ROS movement between organelles. This framework represents an unconventional multiorganelle model of mitochondrial antioxidant defense that expands beyond traditional single-organelle mechanisms.
