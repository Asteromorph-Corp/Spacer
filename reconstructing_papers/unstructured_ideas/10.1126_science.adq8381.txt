Intrinsically disordered regions in proteins interact with partners through complementary chemical interactions rather than precise amino acid order, creating disordered bound-state complexes whose chemically specific dynamic interactions resist conventional prediction methods. Chemical physics principles from molecular simulations can be repurposed to predict this chemical specificity between IDRs and partner proteins using only protein sequence as input. The FINCHES approach leverages these repurposed principles to directly predict phase diagrams, identify chemically specific interaction hotspots on IDRs, and decompose chemically distinct domains within IDRs. This framework provides a computational route to develop and test mechanistic hypotheses regarding IDR function in molecular recognition by translating sequence information into predictions of chemical interaction patterns.
