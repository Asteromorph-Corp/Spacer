DMDS attracts saprophilous pollinators through its volatile properties, presenting a target trait for understanding how plants evolve novel pollination strategies. MTOX represents a highly conserved enzyme across animals and plants whose existing biochemical framework could potentially be modified to produce different sulfur compounds. The research proposes that specific amino acid substitutions in MTOX can convert its function to that of DSS, which synthesizes DMDS instead of the enzyme's original metabolic products. This co-option mechanism suggests that evolutionary transitions between these enzymatic functions require minimal genetic changes, providing a pathway for plants to independently acquire DMDS production. The approach examines whether the same critical amino acid positions drive the MTOX-to-DSS conversion across multiple plant genera that have separately evolved this pollinator attraction system.
