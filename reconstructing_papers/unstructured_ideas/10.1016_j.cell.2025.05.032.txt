TLR7 and TLR8 use two distinct binding pockets to recognize RNA degradation products from endolysosomal nucleases as pathogen-associated signals. Pseudouridine modifications in endogenous RNA create a dual-layer protection mechanism that prevents inappropriate immune activation. RNase T2 and PLD exonucleases fail to adequately process pseudouridine-containing RNA into the oligonucleotide fragments required for TLR recognition. Additionally, TLR8 cannot bind pseudouridine in its first pocket while TLR7 cannot engage pseudouridine-containing RNA through its second pocket, providing redundant discrimination against self-RNA. The study exploits N1-methylpseudouridine as a comparative probe, since this modification bypasses nuclease processing like pseudouridine but retains the ability to directly activate TLR8, revealing how specific chemical features of RNA modifications determine immune recognition patterns.
