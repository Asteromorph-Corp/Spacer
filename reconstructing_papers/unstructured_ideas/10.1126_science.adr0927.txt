Neural population activity in the lateral entorhinal cortex exhibits continuous drift along a one-dimensional manifold that operates independently of behavior, providing an intrinsic temporal framework for event organization. This drift serves as a baseline coordinate system that can be segmented by discrete shifts in population dynamics, which occur at event boundaries and create distinct temporal units from the continuous neural stream. During tasks with recurring temporal structure, neural activity moves in directions orthogonal to the primary drift, allowing the same neural population to simultaneously encode multiple timescales through a hierarchical coordinate system that captures both the intrinsic temporal flow and structured event information.
