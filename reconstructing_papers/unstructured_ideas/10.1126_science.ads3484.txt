Centromeres exhibit epigenetically specified chromatin despite extensive DNA sequence divergence between species and individuals that complicates comparative analyses. A functionally relevant centromeric DNA motif displays conserved spacing patterns that create chromosome-specific architectural signatures across the human genome. The position, orientation, and organization of these motifs along chromosome arms form a distributional map called the human "centeny map." A custom Genomic Centromere Profiling (GCP) pipeline exploits these motif characteristics to construct structural models that can reclassify human chromosomal clusters, detect centromere expansion, and identify structural variants and misassembled regions. This architectural pattern-based approach provides high-resolution mapping that enables comparative centromere analysis across evolution and disease while offering a novel framework for chromosome annotation, assembly, and characterization.
