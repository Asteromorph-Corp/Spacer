STAT3 and STAT5 transcriptional pathways in dendritic cells exhibit dynamic interplay that determines dendritic cell fate and subsequent T cell priming capacity during immune checkpoint blockade. STAT3 acts as a transcriptional restraint on the JAK2 and STAT5 pathway, creating a regulatory circuit where STAT3 activation in the tumour microenvironment suppresses dendritic cell immunogenicity. The research concept exploits this transcriptional crosstalk by employing PROTAC degraders to selectively eliminate STAT3 protein, thereby releasing JAK2 and STAT5 from transcriptional suppression and reprogramming dendritic cells toward an immunogenic phenotype. Two distinct PROTAC molecules, SD-36 and SD-2301, serve as proteolysis-targeting tools that can degrade STAT3 specifically within dendritic cells. This targeted protein degradation approach represents an unconventional strategy to manipulate transcriptional networks by removing the inhibitory transcription factor rather than directly activating the desired pathway, potentially overcoming immune checkpoint blockade resistance through dendritic cell reprogramming.
