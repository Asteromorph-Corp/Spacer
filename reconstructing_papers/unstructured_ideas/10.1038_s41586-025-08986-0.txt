Cell heterogeneity emerges through unknown mechanisms despite its fundamental role in developmental plasticity, tumour heterogeneity, and differential drug responses, while retrospective analyses of mutational and epigenetic signatures cannot resolve how cellular heterogeneity propagates across cell generations. Endogenously labelled proteins enable multigenerational single-cell tracking through their stable inheritance patterns, and dual CRISPR-based genome editing allows simultaneous monitoring of DNA replication patterns and heritable endogenous DNA lesions due to CRISPR's capacity for precise genomic modifications. Cell lineage trees spanning up to four generations can be constructed in asynchronously growing cells, and time-resolved lineage analyses combined with iterative staining of cell cycle and DNA damage markers reveal the temporal dynamics of sister cell asymmetry emergence. Single-cell transcriptomics integration captures the molecular states underlying phenotypic transitions, enabling delineation of how oncogenic perturbations trigger multiple routes towards polyploidization with distinct genome integrity outcomes.
