Adult hippocampal neurogenesis remains controversial in humans because proliferating progenitor cells are difficult to detect using conventional methods. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing can capture the transcriptomic signatures of neural progenitor cell stages across human development from birth through adulthood. The proliferation marker Ki67 combined with machine learning algorithms provides a computational approach to identify actively dividing neural progenitor cells that might be missed by traditional detection methods. The dentate gyrus serves as the specific anatomical location where transcriptomic analysis can reveal the presence and localization of neural progenitors in adult human tissue.
