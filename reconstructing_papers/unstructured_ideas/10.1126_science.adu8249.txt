The constraints governing gene expression pattern evolution across development can be investigated by leveraging single-cell RNA sequencing to systematically profile homologous cells between species. The conserved invariant embryonic lineage of Caenorhabditis elegans and C. briggsae provides an ideal system for comparing cell type gene expression across evolution because their fixed developmental patterns enable precise homologous cell identification. Single-cell RNA sequencing allows measurement of spatiotemporal divergence of gene expression across embryogenesis by capturing expression profiles at cellular resolution throughout developmental time. This approach systematically compares gene expression programs between species to identify which cell types and functional categories show evolutionary divergence versus conservation, revealing the developmental constraints that shape gene expression evolution.
