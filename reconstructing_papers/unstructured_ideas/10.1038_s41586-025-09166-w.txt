EBV infects both epithelial cells and B cells through viral glycoproteins interacting with host receptors, but no common receptor mediating infection of both major cell targets has been identified. R9AP represents a candidate common receptor because it is present on both cell types and can potentially interact with EBV glycoproteins. The proposed study examines whether R9AP functions as a crucial EBV receptor by manipulating R9AP expression levels, blocking R9AP activity with derived peptides and monoclonal antibodies, and testing direct binding interactions between R9AP and the EBV gH/gL complex. The research investigates whether R9AP initiates gH/gL-gB-mediated membrane fusion and whether this interaction can be competitively inhibited by the gH/gL-neutralizing antibody AMMO1. The study tests whether R9AP mediates viral and cellular membrane fusion in cooperation with established cell-type-specific complexes, specifically EBV gp42-human leukocyte antigen class II in B cells and gH/gL-EPHA2 in epithelial cells.
