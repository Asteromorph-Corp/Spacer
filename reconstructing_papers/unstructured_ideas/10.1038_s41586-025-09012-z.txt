The fatal nature of leptomeningeal metastasis in cerebrospinal-fluid-filled leptomeninges stems from an inflammatory infiltrate enriched with IFNγ that fails to control tumor growth despite robust immune activation. Transgenic mouse models lacking IFNγ or its receptor demonstrate that this cytokine paradoxically enables rather than prevents leptomeningeal metastases control, while targeted adeno-associated-virus-based overexpression of Ifng directly suppresses cancer cell growth independent of adaptive immunity. The unique mechanism operates through leptomeningeal T cells that generate IFNγ to recruit and activate peripheral myeloid cells, creating diverse dendritic cell subsets where migratory CCR7+ dendritic cells orchestrate natural killer cell influx, proliferation and cytotoxic action against cancer cells without requiring antigen presentation. This leptomeninges-specific IFNγ signalling pathway represents an unconventional immune-therapeutic target that exploits the compartmentalized nature of cerebrospinal fluid spaces to redirect futile inflammatory responses into effective tumor control.
