Microscopy reveals nuclear protein organization while genomics identifies gene expression patterns, but existing methods cannot simultaneously capture both types of information at subnuclear resolution within individual cells. Expansion in situ genome sequencing combines tissue expansion with in situ sequencing to enable simultaneous genomic DNA sequencing and superresolution protein localization in single cells. This approach leverages the spatial preservation properties of expansion microscopy to maintain nuclear architecture while making DNA accessible for sequencing reactions. The method applies to progeria-derived fibroblasts where lamin structural abnormalities can be spatially correlated with chromatin regulation patterns. Lamin proteins function as transcriptional repressors, creating a direct link between nuclear morphology variations and gene regulatory changes that could affect cellular identity across different tissues and aging conditions.
