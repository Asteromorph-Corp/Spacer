The paclitaxel biosynthetic pathway in yew trees remains incomplete despite decades of research due to Taxus' large, enzyme-rich genome that confounds conventional RNA-sequencing and co-expression analyses. Multiplexed perturbation × single nuclei transcriptional profiling captures cell states across tissues, cell types, developmental stages and elicitation conditions to increase resolution for identifying biosynthetic genes within complex genomes. This approach reveals that paclitaxel biosynthetic genes segregate into distinct expression modules corresponding to consecutive subpathways, enabling systematic reconstruction of the complete metabolic route. The nuclear transport factor 2-like protein FoTO1 promotes formation of the desired product during the first oxidation step, addressing a critical bottleneck in pathway reconstitution, while a β-phenylalanine-CoA ligase contributes to the early biosynthetic steps. Heterologous expression of the identified genes in Nicotiana benthamiana enables de novo biosynthesis of baccatin III and represents a scalable strategy for discovering high-value gene sets in large, uncharacterized plant genomes.
