Kupffer cells acquire tissue-specific transcriptional signatures during liver colonization in embryogenesis and perform core functions including erythrocyte recycling and metabolic support that are essential for liver homeostasis. Maternal obesity provides a model to perturb Kupffer cell functions during gestation, as these tissue-resident macrophages undergo developmental programming that persists into adulthood. Programmed Kupffer cells promote hepatocyte lipid uptake through apolipoprotein secretion, suggesting their aberrant development drives fatty liver disease in offspring. The approach involves depleting Kupffer cells in neonates and replenishing them with naive monocytes to test whether reversing the programming rescues disease. HIF1α mediates the metabolic programming of Kupffer cells from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis during gestation, positioning genetic ablation of HIF1α in macrophages as a strategy to prevent developmental perturbations and subsequent fatty liver disease.
