Adipose tissue remodeling drives the metabolic improvements seen with weight loss, yet the underlying cellular mechanisms remain poorly understood. A spatially resolved single-nucleus atlas approach can map the cell types, molecular events, and regulatory factors that reshape human adipose tissue during obesity and therapeutic weight loss. Senescence selectively affects metabolic, precursor and vascular cells in obesity, creating a degenerative cycle of tissue injury and metabolic dysfunction that weight loss can potentially reverse. Weight loss may reduce adipocyte hypertrophy and biomechanical constraint pathways while activating global metabolic flux and bioenergetic substrate cycles. Macrophage infiltration increases during obesity and partially persists after weight loss, potentially priming cells for metabolic dysfunction during weight regain. Mapping cells to tissue niches reveals how collective cellular behaviors determine tissue injury and recovery patterns in adipose tissue.
