The brain's information-processing capability stems from physical wiring patterns between neurons and their molecular characteristics, requiring nanoscale resolution mapping to resolve individual synaptic connections. Light microscopy uniquely visualizes specific molecules but lacks the resolution, contrast and volumetric imaging capability needed for dense, synapse-level circuit reconstruction. Specifically engineered hydrogel embedding and expansion can overcome these physical limitations by magnifying tissue while preserving molecular details. Deep-learning-based segmentation and analysis of connectivity can process the complex volumetric data to identify synaptic connections within the expanded tissue. LICONN integrates hydrogel expansion with deep-learning analysis to directly incorporate molecular information into synapse-level reconstructions, enabling synapse-level phenotyping through light microscopy rather than electron microscopy.
