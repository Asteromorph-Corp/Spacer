Eukaryotic genomes organize into A and B compartments through mechanisms that may be encoded in the biophysical properties of individual nucleosomes rather than requiring trans factors. Native mononucleosomes from different chromosomal regions exhibit distinct condensability when exposed to physiological concentrations of polyamines, with A compartment regions showing low condensability and B compartment regions displaying high condensability. This condensability difference arises from electrostatic properties inherent to nucleosome composition and correlates with gene expression states in a cell type-dependent manner. Chromatin polymer simulations can reproduce A/B compartment organization using only nucleosome condensability as input, suggesting that 3D genome architecture emerges from the intrinsic biophysical characteristics of individual nucleosomes. Polyamine depletion through ornithine decarboxylase manipulation forces cells to compensate by hyperpolarizing condensability contrast, revealing how cellular polyamine availability modulates the translation of nucleosome biophysical properties into higher-order chromatin organization.
