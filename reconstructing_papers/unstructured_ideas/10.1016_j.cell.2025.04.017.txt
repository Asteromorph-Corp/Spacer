During cellular differentiation, enhancers must convert overlapping gradients of transcription factors into highly specific gene expression patterns, yet the vast complexity of regulatory DNA obscures the underlying cis-regulatory rules. Fully synthetic DNA sequences provide a bottom-up approach to dissect design principles of cell-state-specific enhancers by systematically testing binding sites for transcription factors and their pairwise interactions across the differentiation of blood stem cells to myeloid lineages. The synthetic sequences enable examination of how identical sites can display both repressive and activating function depending on cell state, site combinatorics, and predicted occupancy of transcription factors on enhancers. Combinations of activating sites frequently neutralize one another or gain repressive function through negative synergies that convert quantitative imbalances in transcription factor expression into binary activity patterns. This principle allows automatic creation of enhancers with specificity to user-defined combinations of hematopoietic progenitor cell states from scratch.
