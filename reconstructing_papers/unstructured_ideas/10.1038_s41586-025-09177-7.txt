Mycobacterial PurF serves as the first enzyme in the de novo purine biosynthesis pathway, making it essential for DNA replication when salvage pathways cannot provide sufficient nucleobases. The inadequate concentrations of nucleobases in lung tissue create a dependency on de novo synthesis that can be exploited through selective PurF inhibition. JNJ-6640 represents a first-in-class small-molecule inhibitor designed to target this vulnerability by blocking PurF with high selectivity for mycobacterial enzymes over host counterparts. The compound's bactericidal mechanism operates through disrupting purine availability, which subsequently impairs DNA replication at the single-cell level. Long-acting injectable formulation enables sustained drug exposure to overcome the metabolic resilience of tuberculosis bacteria and potentially enhance treatment regimens against drug-resistant strains.
