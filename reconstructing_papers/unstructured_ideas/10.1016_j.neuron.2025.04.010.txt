Alzheimer's disease begins with amyloid-beta accumulation in the neocortex, but the specific cortical layers and neuronal cell types that first become vulnerable remain unclear. The prolonged Ca2+ transients characteristic of neuronal dysfunction can be detected through in vivo two-photon Ca2+ imaging before substantial plaque formation occurs. Parvalbumin-positive fast-spiking interneurons in deep cortical layers may exhibit selective vulnerability due to their dependence on specific synaptic machinery, while those in superficial layers might be protected by different molecular environments. Neuronal pentraxin 2 regulates excitatory synapse formation and maintenance, particularly onto interneurons, and GluA4 subunits are critical for fast synaptic transmission in parvalbumin-positive fast-spiking interneurons. The study proposes using Neuropixels recordings combined with visual cortex stimulation in AD mouse models to identify layer-specific dysfunction patterns, followed by molecular analysis of neuronal pentraxin 2 and GluA4 expression changes. The research concept centers on testing whether neuronal pentraxin 2 overexpression can restore excitatory input onto deep-layer parvalbumin-positive fast-spiking interneurons and rescue their functional deficits.
