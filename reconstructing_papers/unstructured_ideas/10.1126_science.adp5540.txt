Metabolic dysfunction–associated steatohepatitis progression involves disrupted ceramide metabolism through intestinal ceramide synthetase 6 activity, suggesting that targeted inhibition of CerS6 could reverse disease development. Fusarium foetens exists as an intestinal symbiotic filamentous fungus whose secondary metabolites may naturally modulate host ceramide pathways. The research systematically isolates and characterizes gut fungi to identify species capable of producing CerS6 inhibitors, then examines how F. foetens metabolites interact with the intestinal CerS6–ceramide axis in mouse models of MASH. The approach leverages the unique capacity of fungal secondary metabolites to cross-regulate host enzyme systems, particularly focusing on FF-C1 as a naturally occurring CerS6 inhibitor that could demonstrate endogenous protective mechanisms against metabolic liver disease.
