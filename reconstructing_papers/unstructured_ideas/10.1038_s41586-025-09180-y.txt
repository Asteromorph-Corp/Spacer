Perceptual learning in the sensory cortex involves neural plasticity, but whether this plasticity arises from supervised learning with instruction or unsupervised learning without instruction remains unclear. Neural populations in the primary visual cortex and higher visual areas can be simultaneously recorded during both rewarded task performance and unrewarded stimulus exposure to distinguish between these two learning mechanisms. The comparison between neural changes during rewarded versus unrewarded conditions allows determination of whether plasticity depends on instructional signals or occurs automatically through stimulus exposure. Visual learning rules rather than spatial learning rules may govern plasticity patterns across different cortical areas, with medial higher visual areas potentially showing the strongest changes. Reward-prediction signals in anterior higher visual areas during task performance could indicate supervised learning processes operating alongside unsupervised mechanisms. This framework proposes that unsupervised learning might facilitate subsequent supervised task learning, suggesting these learning types interact rather than operate independently.
