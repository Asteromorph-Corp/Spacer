Individual organisms can function as natural reaction platforms containing high densities of multiple enzymes that perform complex reactions through their inherent xenobiotic metabolism. Belt- and ring-shaped molecular nanocarbons possess structural properties that make them suitable substrates for enzymatic transformation within living insect systems. Cytochrome P450 variants naturally present in insects can catalyze the insertion of oxygen atoms directly into carbonâ€“carbon bonds of these nanocarbons, creating derivatives that are otherwise difficult to prepare through conventional synthetic approaches. This in-insect unnatural product synthesis leverages the insects' existing metabolic machinery to achieve unconventional oxygen insertion reactions that transform the aromatic ring structures of the molecular nanocarbons.
