The peripheral nervous system's extensive distribution throughout the body presents mapping challenges that contrast with recent progress in brain connectomics, requiring a new approach that can capture micrometer-scale neural architecture across entire organisms. A high-speed blockface volumetric imaging system integrates whole-body clearing protocols to achieve rapid, high-resolution imaging of complete adult mouse specimens. Thy1-EGFP expression enables three-dimensional reconstruction of individual spinal fibers, leveraging the fluorescent protein's selective labeling to distinguish morphological characteristics of sensory and motor projections along ventral and dorsal rami. Immunostaining protocols target sympathetic nerve networks body-wide, exploiting specific molecular markers to reveal perivascular innervation patterns across diverse tissue types including limb muscles, bones, and visceral organs. Viral tracing techniques map vagus nerve architecture at single-fiber resolution, utilizing viral vectors' capacity for precise neural circuit labeling to trace individual vagal projections and their organ-specific routing patterns.
