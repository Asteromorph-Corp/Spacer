De novo protein design can create artificial enzymes by incorporating histidine-ligated synthetic porphyrin and heme ligands into designed protein scaffolds, leveraging histidine's coordination chemistry to anchor these cofactors in precise orientations for catalysis. This approach targets cyclopropanation reactions where the heme cofactor's iron center can form carbene intermediates essential for stereoselective carbon-carbon bond formation. A parallel design strategy focuses on silicon-hydrogen insertion reactions, utilizing the same cofactor framework but optimizing through directed evolution in whole cells to identify structural features like proline residues in Î± helices that computational design alone cannot predict. The evolutionary process narrows the proteins' conformational ensembles toward more catalytically productive states, as revealed by molecular dynamics simulations that track how structural flexibility relates to catalytic efficiency.
