The interpretation of Cambrian Anatolepis fossils as the earliest tooth precursors relies on identifying their tubular structures as dentine tubules, but the fragmentary nature of these specimens and limited comparative data from other exoskeletal tissues creates uncertainty about their true vertebrate identity. Synchrotron scanning of diverse extinct and extant vertebrate and invertebrate exoskeletons enables detailed ultrastructural comparison between the tubules in Anatolepis and confirmed dentine tubules in definitive vertebrates, while also examining aglaspidid arthropod sensory sensilla structures that could represent alternative explanations for the observed tubular patterns. The morphological convergence between large dentine tubules in vertebrate odontodes and invertebrate sensilla suggests these structures share similar organizational principles, prompting investigation of whether vertebrate dental tissues retain sensory properties. Immunofluorescence analysis of external odontodes in extant chondrichthyans and teleosts tests whether extensive innervation patterns support a sensory function for dentine that parallels the known sensory capabilities of teeth. This comparative approach across fossil and living taxa reveals that dentine tissue evolution in early vertebrate exoskeletons involved sensory function as a primary characteristic, establishing odontodes as sensory structures rather than purely protective elements.
