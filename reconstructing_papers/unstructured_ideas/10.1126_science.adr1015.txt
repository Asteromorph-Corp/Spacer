CSF1R mutations cause CSF1R-associated microgliopathy because this receptor's primary expression in microglia makes these cells deficient when the gene is mutated. The conceptual approach exploits the principle that replacing defective microglia with normal cells should correct the underlying pathogenic mechanism. Mouse models harboring human hotspot mutations of CAMP provide the experimental framework to test microglia replacement by bone marrow transplantation, where transplanted bone marrow-derived cells can repopulate the brain and functionally substitute for the genetically deficient resident microglia. The key insight extends traditional bone marrow transplantation beyond its conventional hematopoietic applications to target CNS pathology by leveraging the capacity of bone marrow-derived cells to cross the blood-brain barrier and differentiate into functional microglia.
