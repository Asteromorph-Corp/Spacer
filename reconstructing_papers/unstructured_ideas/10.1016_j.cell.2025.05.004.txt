Pelagic fungi exist throughout the global ocean but their quantitative contribution to carbon stocks remains unknown, preventing their inclusion in biogeochemical models that require precise biomass measurements. Ergosterol serves as a fungal-specific biomarker that enables selective quantification of fungal biomass when extracted from seawater samples. Calcofluor-White staining provides visualization of fungal cell walls through specific binding to chitin and cellulose structures unique to fungi. Catalyzed reporter deposition fluorescence in situ hybridization allows targeted detection and enumeration of fungal cells using species-specific genetic probes with signal amplification. Microfluidic mass sensor techniques measure individual cell masses at the picogram scale, enabling direct biomass determination of microscopic marine organisms. The research concept combines these complementary approaches to quantify pelagic fungal biomass across ocean basins and compare it with bacterial and archaeal biomass to determine fungi's relative contribution to marine carbon stocks.
