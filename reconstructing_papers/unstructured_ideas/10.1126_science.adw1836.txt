MCL-1's essential role in embryogenesis and cell survival, unlike its relatives BCL-XL and BCL-2, suggests it performs unique apoptosis-unrelated metabolic functions beyond standard anti-apoptotic activity. The hypothesis that BCL-XL and BCL-2 can substitute only MCL-1's anti-apoptotic functions while lacking its metabolic capabilities provides a framework for dissecting these distinct roles. Genetic replacement experiments substituting MCL-1 with BCL-XL or BCL-2 in Mcl-1 knockout embryos can test whether anti-apoptotic rescue alone enables survival or whether metabolic deficiencies emerge from missing MCL-1-specific functions. This substitution approach exploits the shared anti-apoptotic mechanisms among these proteins while exposing MCL-1's unique metabolic contributions through functional gaps that replacement proteins cannot fill.
