Early-life stress through prenatal maternal stress exposure creates a model where adult offspring develop both visceral hypersensitivity and anxiety-like behaviors, providing a system to investigate the neural mechanisms linking chronic visceral pain with emotional disorders. Glutamatergic neurons in the anterior paraventricular thalamus respond to visceral pain while those in the posterior paraventricular thalamus respond to anxiety, suggesting anatomically distinct processing of these two conditions within the same brain region. The aPVT connects to the basolateral amygdala to regulate chronic visceral pain, while the pPVT connects to the central amygdala to regulate anxiety, creating separate but potentially interacting neural circuits. Cacna1e expression in the aPVT enhances both visceral pain and anxiety responses, while Grin2a upregulation in the pPVT specifically facilitates anxiety, indicating that distinct molecular mechanisms within different paraventricular thalamus subregions underlie the comorbidity between chronic visceral pain and emotional disorders.
