CAR T cell therapy faces limitations in solid tumours due to immunosuppression and antigen heterogeneity, while armoured CAR T cells that secrete cytokines cause toxicity from peripheral transgene expression. A CRISPR knock-in strategy exploits regulatory mechanisms of endogenous genes to achieve tumour-localized transgene expression. Screening identifies NR4A2 and RGS16 promoters as candidates with tumour-restricted expression patterns that can drive localized delivery of IL-12 and IL-2 cytokines. This approach aims to enhance antitumour efficacy while improving CAR T cell polyfunctionality and activating endogenous antitumour immunity with reduced systemic toxicity.
