G-quadruplexes form prevalent DNA structures that regulate transcription while threatening genome stability, creating a need to understand how their dynamics are controlled. RNA transcripts can govern G4 landscapes through a coordinated assembly and disassembly mechanism called G-loop formation. The assembly process exploits ATM and ATR kinases for activation, followed by BRCA2 and RAD51-mediated homology-directed invasion where RNA invades opposite the G4 strand. The disassembly mechanism utilizes DHX36-FANCJ helicases to unwind G4 structures, triggering nucleolytic incision and subsequent hybrid strand renewal through DNA synthesis. This G-loop assembly-disassembly cycle represents an intricate regulatory mechanism that controls G4 landscapes by coordinating transcriptional regulation with genome stability maintenance.
