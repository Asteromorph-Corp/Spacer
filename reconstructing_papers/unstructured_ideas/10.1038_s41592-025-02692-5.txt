Voltage imaging suffers from tissue scattering that prevents resolution of individual neurons in dense populations during high-speed recording of neuronal activity. The sparse activation of neurons during action potentials creates temporally isolated fluorescence changes that can be precisely localized using principles borrowed from localization microscopy, which achieves super-resolution by localizing single molecules. This activity localization imaging approach exploits the temporal sparsity of action potentials to separate overlapping neuronal signals that tissue scattering would otherwise blend together. The method applies localization principles to fluorescence changes associated with each action potential, creating super-resolution maps of neuronal activity from widefield, targeted illumination, and light sheet microscopy data.
