Chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapies face manufacturing complexity and patient accessibility limitations that could be addressed through direct in vivo reprogramming. Targeted lipid nanoparticles can deliver messenger RNA specifically to T cell subsets, bypassing the need for ex vivo cell manipulation. CD8+ T cells possess the capacity for CAR expression when transfected with appropriate mRNA constructs, enabling functional antigen recognition and cytotoxic responses. The targeted delivery system exploits T cell surface markers to achieve selective transfection while avoiding off-target effects in other cell populations. This approach reprograms T cells directly within the patient's body, eliminating complex manufacturing steps and potentially broadening therapeutic applications beyond current CAR T cell limitations.
