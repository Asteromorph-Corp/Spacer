Epigenetic pathways can enable inheritance of acquired characteristics through DNA methylation changes that alter gene expression patterns in response to environmental stress. Cold-sensitive cultivated Asian rice subjected to multigenerational cold stress can develop heritable cold tolerance through DNA hypomethylation variations in the ACT1 promoter region, which renders ACT1 expression insensitive to cold temperatures. This hypomethylation-driven expression change creates an epiallele that maintains cold tolerance across generations without underlying DNA sequence alterations. DNA methylation editing can be used to confirm the causal relationship between ACT1 methylation status and cold tolerance acquisition. The approach examines how environmental stress triggers stable epigenetic modifications that produce adaptive traits, demonstrating a mechanistic pathway for Lamarckian inheritance through methylation-mediated gene regulation.
