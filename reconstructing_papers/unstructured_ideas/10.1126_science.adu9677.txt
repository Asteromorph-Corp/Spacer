Denisovans represent a hominin group known primarily through genomic and protein data, while their morphological features remain unclear due to fragmentary fossil evidence. The Harbin cranium, previously assigned to Homo longi, provides an opportunity to bridge this gap through endogenous protein extraction from ancient bone material. These proteins contain amino acid variants that can be compared to known Denisovan sequences, particularly those from Denisova 3, to determine population affinity through molecular clustering analysis. The approach links preserved protein sequences in well-preserved cranial remains to established Denisovan genetic signatures, potentially connecting specific morphological traits to this hominin group for the first time.
