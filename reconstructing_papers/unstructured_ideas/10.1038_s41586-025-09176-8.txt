Cancer-associated neurons enhance cancer cell metabolic plasticity through direct mitochondrial transfer, a process that can be investigated using breast cancer denervation and nerve-cancer coculture models. Neurons cocultured with cancer cells undergo metabolic reprogramming that increases their mitochondrial mass, which then enables the transfer of these mitochondria to adjacent cancer cells. MitoTRACER, a reporter system for cell-to-cell mitochondrial transfer, permanently labels recipient cancer cells and their progeny to track the fate of cells acquiring neuronal mitochondria. Lineage tracing and fate mapping techniques can identify cancer cells that have received neuronal mitochondria in primary tumours and determine whether these cells show selective enrichment at metastatic sites following dissemination.
