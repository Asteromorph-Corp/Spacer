Within the intestine, peripherally-induced regulatory T cells suppress inflammatory responses to food proteins, but the antigen-presenting cells that instruct food-specific pTreg cells remain poorly understood. A subset of Thetis cells called TC IV exists almost exclusively within mesenteric lymph nodes, positioning them to potentially mediate oral tolerance through their unique anatomical distribution. TC IV cells undergo differentiation during the peri-weaning period, creating a temporal window that coincides with enhanced pTreg generation capacity. This study proposes to investigate whether TC IV cells are required for food-specific pTreg cell differentiation by examining the causal relationship between TC IV presence and the oral tolerance phenomenon.
