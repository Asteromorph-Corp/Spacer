Exome sequencing fails to diagnose most patients with rare genetic diseases because pathogenic variants in non-coding sequence remain unrecognized. Non-coding promoter variants can dysregulate gene expression through mechanisms not captured by current diagnostic approaches. PromoterAI uses a deep neural network architecture to identify promoter variants with expression-altering consequences by learning patterns that distinguish pathogenic from benign non-coding variation. The approach leverages the principle that variants causing outlier expression at RNA and protein levels in large populations should experience negative selection pressure, providing a training signal for the neural network. Reporter assays validate the functional impact of predicted variants by directly measuring their effects on gene expression regulation.
