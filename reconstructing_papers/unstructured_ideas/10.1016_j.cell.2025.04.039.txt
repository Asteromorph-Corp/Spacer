TDP-43 normally resides in the nucleus but forms cytosolic aggregates in neurodegenerative diseases through a proposed double-trigger mechanism involving stress granule concentration and oxidative stress. Stress granules can up-concentrate TDP-43 beyond a critical threshold, while oxidative stress provides the second necessary condition for pathological transformation. These combined triggers drive intra-condensate demixing, where TDP-43 separates into a distinct enriched phase within existing stress granules that subsequently converts to pathological aggregates. The demixing process depends on oxidative stress causing local unfolding of the RRM1 domain to enable intermolecular disulfide bond formation, alongside enhanced hydrophobic patch interactions in the C-terminal domain that promote phase separation. Engineering TDP-43 variants that resist intra-condensate demixing offers a strategy to prevent aggregate formation by disrupting this concentration-dependent phase transition pathway.
