Viral proteomes remain incompletely mapped because conventional methods cannot systematically identify all translated regions across diverse viral genomes. Ribosome profiling detects active translation by capturing ribosome-protected RNA fragments, but standard approaches lack the throughput to survey thousands of viral sequences simultaneously. Massively parallel ribosome profiling addresses this limitation by analyzing ribosome occupancy across tens of thousands of designed oligonucleotides in a single experiment. This approach enables systematic detection of open reading frames across hundreds of human-associated viral genomes, including noncanonical ORFs that escape traditional annotation methods. The method leverages the fundamental property that actively translating ribosomes protect specific RNA sequences from nuclease digestion, allowing identification of previously unknown translated regions that may function as regulatory elements or encode functional peptides.
