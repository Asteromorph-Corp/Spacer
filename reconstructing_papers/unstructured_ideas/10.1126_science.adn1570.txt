Squid dorsal mantle tissues achieve reversible transitions between nearly transparent and vibrantly colored states through iridophores containing Bragg reflectors with sinusoidal-wave refractive index profiles that manipulate light through varying refractive index distributions. The rugate refractive index profiles within these iridescent cells enable dynamic structural coloration by controlling how light interacts with the tissue's optical properties. This biological mechanism of leveraging refractive index differences for dynamic color changes serves as inspiration for designing iridophore-inspired multispectral composite materials that replicate the squid's optical manipulation principles. The proposed approach involves translating the understanding of how these Bragg reflectors function in living systems into engineered materials with tunable visible and infrared functionalities.
