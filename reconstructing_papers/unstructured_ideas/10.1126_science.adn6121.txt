Human neurons can be programmed through transcription factor overexpression to model neuronal differentiation, but the full diversity of neuronal subtypes achievable in vitro remains unclear. Developmental signaling pathways naturally pattern neural progenitors along specific axes during embryogenesis, while transcription factors drive terminal differentiation into distinct neuronal fates. The concept combines systematic modulation of morphogen signaling with transcription factor induction in pluripotent stem cells to explore the complete spectrum of programmable neuron subtypes. Multiplexed single-cell transcriptomic screening across hundreds of signaling conditions enables comprehensive mapping of the resulting neuronal diversity. The key insight involves patterning neural progenitors with developmental signals before transcription factor overexpression to access broader regulon programs that mirror those active in primary tissue counterparts.
