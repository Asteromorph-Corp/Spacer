Primary enteric sensory neurons producing neuromedin U and calcitonin gene-related peptide β express receptors for the type 2 cytokines interleukin-4 and IL-13, creating a potential bidirectional communication pathway between immune signals and enteric neural responses. Type 2 cytokines can amplify neuropeptide expression in these neurons through Il13ra1 signaling, suggesting that inflammatory cues directly modulate enteric neuron function during immune responses. This concept proposes that disrupting Il13ra1-mediated signaling in primary enteric sensory neurons will impair host defense against gastrointestinal helminths like Heligmosomoides polygyrus, while co-administration of neuromedin U and calcitonin gene-related peptide β should rescue immune deficits. The approach tests whether enteric neurons serve as active participants in type 2 inflammation rather than passive modulators, positioning Il13ra1 as a critical receptor linking cytokine signals to neuropeptide-mediated immune regulation.
