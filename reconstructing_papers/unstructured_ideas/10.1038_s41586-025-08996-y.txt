The idea proposes testing individual amino acid removal to identify which restriction most effectively induces weight loss in mice, based on the premise that different amino acids may have distinct metabolic roles that could be exploited for obesity intervention. Cysteine emerges as the target because its restriction should simultaneously deplete two critical cellular components: glutathione (GSH), which maintains cellular redox balance, and coenzyme A (CoA), which is essential for mitochondrial energy production. The conceptual framework centers on creating a dual metabolic disruption where cysteine deficiency triggers both the integrated stress response and oxidative stress response, pathways that amplify each other to induce the hunger-suppressing hormones GDF15 and FGF21. The approach exploits the unique position of cysteine in cellular metabolism, where its absence forces cells into energetically inefficient anaerobic glycolysis while simultaneously compromising the tricarboxylic acid cycle, creating a metabolic state that promotes rapid weight loss through reduced mitochondrial functionality and sustained urinary excretion of metabolic intermediates including pyruvate, orotate, citrate, Î±-ketoglutarate, nitrogen-rich compounds and amino acids.
