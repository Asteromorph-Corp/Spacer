CRISPR-associated transposases offer RNA-guided DNA integration capability but exhibit minimal activity in human cells, limiting their use for treating loss-of-function genetic diseases through programmable gene insertion. Phage-assisted continuous evolution can systematically improve protein function through iterative rounds of mutagenesis and selection under controlled evolutionary pressure. The approach subjects CRISPR-associated transposases to phage-assisted continuous evolution to generate variants with enhanced integration activity in human cells. The evolved system targets kilobase-size DNA cargoes to specific genomic loci including safe harbor sites and disease-relevant genes, employing the improved transposase variants to achieve efficient programmable integration while minimizing off-target effects and avoiding indel formation.
