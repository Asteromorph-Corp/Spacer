Tumor-infiltrating CD8 T cells express serotonin transporter (SERT), which depletes intratumoral T cell-autocrine serotonin and functions as a negative-feedback regulator that inhibits CD8 T cell reactivities. This mechanism positions SERT as an immune checkpoint that can be targeted using selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) to block serotonin depletion and restore T cell antitumor immunity. The concept leverages SSRIs' established pharmacological action of inhibiting serotonin reuptake to repurpose these widely prescribed antidepressants as cancer immunotherapy agents. The approach includes combining SSRI treatment with programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) blockade to exploit therapeutic synergy between targeting the intratumoral serotonin axis and existing checkpoint inhibition.
