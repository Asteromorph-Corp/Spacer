Cell-cell communication drives complex diseases, but current single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics computational approaches suffer from high false-positive rates and detect only single ligand-receptor interactions between cell populations rather than individual cells. Cell Neural Networks on Spatial Transcriptomics (CellNEST) leverages the spatial positioning of individual cells in tissue to model communication as neural network-like pathways that can identify relay-network communication patterns involving ligand-receptor-ligand-receptor chains. The approach treats each cell as a node whose communication potential depends on its spatial coordinates and expression profile, enabling detection of multi-step signaling cascades where intermediate cells relay signals between distant cell populations. CellNEST applies this relay-network framework to decode T cell homing signals in human lymph nodes, aggressive cancer communication in lung adenocarcinoma and colorectal cancer, and potential relay networks in pancreatic cancer.
