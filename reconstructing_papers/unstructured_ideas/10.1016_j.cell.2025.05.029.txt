Interferon-Î³-driven inflammation induces the immunoproteasome subunit PSMB8 in neurons, disrupting the normal proteasomal balance and reducing overall proteasome activity. This impaired proteasome function prevents the degradation of PFKFB3, a key metabolic regulator that accumulates and shifts neuronal metabolism toward enhanced glycolysis while reducing pentose phosphate pathway activity. The metabolic imbalance creates oxidative stress conditions that trigger ferroptosis in neurons, linking inflammatory signaling to metabolic disruption and cell death. The research proposes targeting either PSMB8 to restore proteasomal balance or PFKFB3 to correct the metabolic dysfunction as therapeutic approaches for protecting neurons in multiple sclerosis and potentially other neurodegenerative diseases.
