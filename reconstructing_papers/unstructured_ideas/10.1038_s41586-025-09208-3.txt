Gastrointestinal motility disorders arise from dysfunction of inhibitory nitric oxide-producing motor neurons in the enteric nervous system, whose loss causes severe conditions like achalasia and gastroparesis. Human pluripotent stem cells can generate these specialized neurons through directed differentiation protocols that recapitulate their natural developmental programs. Platelet-derived growth factor receptors normally inhibit NO neuron specification from enteric nervous system precursors, so blocking these receptors enhances the differentiation of functional inhibitory motor neurons. The resulting hPSC-derived NO neurons can be screened against drug libraries to identify compounds that modulate their activity and enhance motility in tissue models. Transplantation of these engineered neurons into deficient mouse models provides a cell-based therapeutic approach that directly replaces the missing neuronal population responsible for proper gut motility regulation.
