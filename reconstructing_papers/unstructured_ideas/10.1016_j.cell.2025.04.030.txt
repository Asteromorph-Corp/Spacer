Neuronal growth and regeneration depend on local translation of mRNAs in axons, creating an opportunity to investigate how injury-induced transcriptional changes might regulate this process through novel RNA species. A specific subset of polyadenylated B2-SINE repeat elements, termed GI-SINEs, emerges from ATF3 and other AP-1 promoter-associated extragenic loci upon sensory neuron injury, suggesting these transposable elements could serve as regulatory intermediates linking transcriptional activation to translational control. GI-SINEs interact with ribosomal proteins and nucleolin, an axon-growth-regulating RNA-binding protein, positioning them to directly modulate translation machinery in neuronal cytoplasm. The research concept involves demonstrating that exogenous GI-SINE expression can elicit axonal growth across different neuronal types and that antisense oligos against GI-SINEs can disrupt both sensory neuron outgrowth and nucleolin-ribosome interactions, thereby establishing a physiological circuit where transposable elements function as essential components connecting AP-1 transcription with localized RNA translation during regeneration.
