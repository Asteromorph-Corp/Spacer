Haploid cells of the pathogenic fungi Sclerotinia sclerotiorum and Botrytis cinerea distribute their chromosomes in a manner that results in individual nuclei containing only subsets of the complete haploid chromosome complement rather than the expected full set. This unconventional chromosomal distribution can be detected through chromosome counting, fluorescence in situ hybridization, flow cytometryâ€“based DNA measurements, and single-nucleus polymerase chain reaction experiments that reveal the presence of incomplete chromosome sets within individual nuclear compartments. The phenomenon represents a departure from established principles of nuclear organization where each nucleus typically houses complete haploid or diploid chromosome sets, suggesting that these fungal species have evolved alternative mechanisms for distributing genetic material across multiple nuclei within single cells.
