Emotional responses to sensory experience involve neural mechanisms that may be conserved across mammalian species, suggesting that studying both humans and mice could reveal fundamental principles of how emotion emerges from sensation. A cross-species neural activity screen combines precise affective behavioral measurements with clinical medication administration and brain-wide intracranial electrophysiology to identify shared neural patterns underlying emotional processing. This approach tests whether emotionally salient sensory signals follow consistent dynamics across species, specifically examining biphasic patterns where fast broadcast of signals throughout the brain precedes persistent activity phases. Medication-based interventions target these distinct temporal components to determine whether persistent dynamics specifically drive emotional responses while fast broadcast serves other functions. The conceptual framework proposes that mammalian emotion emerges through distributed neural context shaped by persistent dynamics and global intrinsic timescale rather than localized brain regions.
