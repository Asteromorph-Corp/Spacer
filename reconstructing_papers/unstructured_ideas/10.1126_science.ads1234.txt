Early mammalian embryos face the challenge of accurate chromosome segregation during preimplantation development despite lacking efficient spindle assembly mechanisms. Nuclear actin cables form a network that positions prophase chromosomes at the nuclear periphery, then contracts through filament disassembly rather than myosin II-mediated contraction to gather chromosomes toward the cell center following nuclear envelope breakdown. Branched actin filaments create a separate network that controls metaphase spindle elongation to further ensure proper chromosome distribution. This dual actin network system provides an alternative mechanism for maintaining mitotic fidelity when conventional spindle assembly pathways are insufficient.
