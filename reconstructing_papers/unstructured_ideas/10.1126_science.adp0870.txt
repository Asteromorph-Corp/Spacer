Synaptotagmin-1 functions as a calcium sensor with distinct calcium affinity and cooperativity properties compared to Syt2, suggesting that different synaptotagmin isoforms may optimize release machinery performance under varying calcium conditions. Layer 5 pyramidal neuron synapses and cerebellar Purkinje cell synapses provide contrasting synaptic environments where Syt1-triggered and Syt2-triggered release mechanisms can be directly compared through calcium dependency measurements. Laser photolysis of caged calcium enables precise control of calcium elevations to reveal the specific calcium-binding characteristics that distinguish Syt1-mediated synchronous release from other synaptotagmin-dependent mechanisms. Kinetic models can integrate the calcium dependency data from different synaptic preparations to identify the mechanistic differences underlying how Syt1 versus Syt2 couple calcium sensing to vesicle fusion.
