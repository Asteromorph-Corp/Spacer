Salamander limb regeneration depends on anterior and posterior connective tissue cells maintaining distinct positional identities through poorly understood molecular mechanisms called positional memory. Hand2 transcription factor persists in posterior cells from development and enables them to form Shh signalling centres upon amputation, while Shh signalling reciprocally drives Hand2 expression during regeneration to create a positive-feedback loop. This Hand2-Shh circuit maintains posterior identity after regeneration ends by sustaining Hand2 expression even when Shh shuts down. The concept exploits this natural regeneration circuitry to artificially reprogram anterior cells by transiently exposing them to Shh during regeneration, which should establish an ectopic Hand2-Shh loop and convert anterior positional memory to a stable posterior state.
