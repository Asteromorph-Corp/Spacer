Gene regulation in bilaterian animals involves both linear and spatial regulatory information through chromatin compartmentalization, insulation of neighboring genomic regions, and chromatin looping that connects distal cis-regulatory sequences, but the evolutionary origins of these three-dimensional genome architecture features remain unknown across most animal lineages. The study proposes to trace how animal genome regulation evolved by characterizing the physical organization of genomes in non-bilaterian animals including sponges, ctenophores, placozoans and cnidarians, as well as their closest unicellular relatives including ichthyosporeans, filastereans and choanoflagellates. The approach combines high-resolution chromosome conformation capture with epigenomic marks and gene expression data to enable comparative analysis across these diverse lineages. The key conceptual framework centers on determining whether chromatin looping and sequence-determined distal contacts involving promoter–enhancer and promoter–promoter interactions represent ancient features of genome organization or innovations that emerged during animal evolution.
