SP140 acts as a transcriptional repressor that controls interferon-β responses through an indirect mechanism involving mRNA stability rather than direct transcriptional inhibition of Ifnb1. SP140 directly represses expression of RESIST, a previously uncharacterized regulator that promotes Ifnb1 mRNA stability by counteracting the destabilizing effects of tristetraprolin family RNA-binding proteins and the CCR4–NOT deadenylase complex. SP140 localizes within nuclear bodies that silence DNA-virus gene expression, enabling it to inhibit gammaherpesvirus MHV68 replication through a pathway independent of its Ifnb1 regulatory function. The study proposes investigating how SP140 and RESIST function as components of antiviral effector-triggered immunity, revealing a dual regulatory system where SP140 simultaneously controls interferon responses through post-transcriptional mRNA regulation and directly suppresses viral replication through nuclear body-mediated mechanisms.
