Methanogenic archaea produce methane through a pathway that typically relies on two nickel-containing [NiFe]-hydrogenases, where heterodisulfide reductase complexed with Mvh generates low-potential electrons through flavin-based electron-bifurcation and F420-reducing [NiFe]-hydrogenase provides electrons via the F420 carrier. The concept exploits the observation that natural habitats often contain severely limited nickel concentrations, creating conditions where nickel-dependent enzymes become unavailable for the standard methanogenic pathway. Under these nickel-limited conditions, the research proposes that Methanothermobacter marburgensis switches to an alternative electron flow system where [Fe]-hydrogenase substitutes for the F420-reducing [NiFe]-hydrogenase reaction and F420-dependent electron-donating proteins replace Mvh function by forming complexes with heterodisulfide reductase. This approach characterizes the biochemical and structural properties of Elpâ€“Hdr complexes to demonstrate electronic interaction and examines the conservation of genes encoding Elp and Hmd across CO2-reducing hydrogenotrophic methanogens to establish this nickel-independent pathway as a widespread alternative mechanism.
