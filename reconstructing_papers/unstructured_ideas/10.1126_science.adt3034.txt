The antagonistic activities between the 53BP1 axis and BRCA1-BARD1 control whether DNA double-strand breaks undergo end joining or homologous recombination repair. The CST complex acts as a central component within the 53BP1 axis by suppressing DNA end resection through distinct mechanisms that differentially restrict EXO1 and the BLM-DNA2 helicase-nuclease complex. BRCA1-BARD1 selectively counteracts CST's blockade of EXO1 while leaving BLM-DNA2 restriction largely unaffected, creating pathway-specific regulation. CST mutants with impaired DNA binding or defective BLMâ€“EXO1 interaction produce hyper-resection and confer PARP inhibitor resistance to BRCA1-deficient cells. This dual-mechanism approach reveals how CST mechanistically governs DNA repair pathway choice through selective nuclease regulation within the competing 53BP1 and BRCA1 signaling networks.
