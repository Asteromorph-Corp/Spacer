Brain organoids generated from fluorescently labelled human induced pluripotent stem cells offer a system to study self-organization during brain development, where the absence of external guidance allows investigation of intrinsic developmental mechanisms. Long-term live light-sheet microscopy enables continuous tracking of tissue morphology and cellular behaviors over weeks of development, while dual-channel multi-mosaic multi-protein labelling combined with computational demultiplexing permits simultaneous quantification of multiple subcellular features including actin, tubulin, plasma membrane, nucleus and nuclear envelope dynamics during tissue-state transitions. The approach integrates imaging with single-cell transcriptome analysis to examine how lumenal expansion and cell morphotype composition within developing neuroepithelium relate to gene expression programs involving extracellular matrix pathway regulators and mechanosensing. The concept tests whether extrinsically provided matrix influences lumen expansion and telencephalon formation compared to unguided organoids grown without extrinsic matrix, and investigates how matrix-induced regional guidance and lumen morphogenesis connect to WNT and Hippo signalling pathways, particularly through spatially restricted induction of WNT ligand secretion mediator that marks early emergence of non-telencephalic brain regions.
