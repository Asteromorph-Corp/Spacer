The enteric nervous system must detect luminal nutrients to control digestive processes, yet the specific neuronal pathways mediating this sensory function remain undefined along with the system's capacity to distinguish between different chemicals. Calcium imaging can reveal which enteric pathways activate when different nutrients contact the mouse jejunum, potentially showing that distinct neurochemically defined ensembles of myenteric and submucosal neurons respond to specific luminal substances. Since enteric neurons likely detect nutrients indirectly through epithelial intermediates rather than direct nutrient sensitivity, the epithelium probably transduces luminal chemical information via specific signaling molecules like serotonin to communicate with different neuronal populations. This nutrient detection system may organize spatially along the intestine's radial axis, with signals potentially flowing from villus epithelium to myenteric plexus and then to submucosal plexus in a defined sequence that reflects the anatomical relationship between luminal proximity and neural processing.
