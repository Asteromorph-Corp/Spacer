Mechanosensory end-organ development depends on neuronal activity generated by mechanical stimulation, where Piezo2 serves as the primary mechanosensitive ion channel that converts physical forces into electrical signals in somatosensory neurons. Genetic deletion of Piezo2 eliminates this mechanotransduction pathway, preventing the activity-dependent signals necessary for proper end-organ formation during development. Nav1.6 propagates the electrical responses initiated by mechanical stimuli, and its deletion disrupts the voltage-dependent transmission that links mechanosensation to downstream developmental processes. Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals that Piezo2-dependent activity specifically regulates gene expression programs in mechanosensitive neurons, identifying the molecular pathways through which mechanical stimulation controls cellular differentiation. The research tests whether mechanically evoked neuronal activity functions as a developmental signal by examining how genetic disruption of mechanotransduction components affects the morphological maturation of touch-sensitive structures.
