Computationally designed enzymes have exhibited low catalytic rates due to limitations in design methodology that create gaps in understanding biocatalysis fundamentals. A fully computational workflow uses TIM-barrel folds as structural scaffolds because their stable framework can accommodate extensive mutations while maintaining protein integrity. The workflow incorporates backbone fragments from natural proteins to provide validated structural motifs that support catalytic function. Kemp eliminase serves as the target reaction because its well-characterized mechanism allows precise evaluation of computational design success. The approach generates designs with more than 140 mutations from any natural protein, creating novel active sites that challenge the assumption that natural protein sequences are optimal for catalytic efficiency. The methodology eliminates the need for mutant-library screening by computationally optimizing both catalytic residues and stabilizing mutations simultaneously. Redesigning a residue previously considered essential in all Kemp eliminase designs tests whether computational methods can identify superior solutions beyond conventional biocatalytic assumptions.
