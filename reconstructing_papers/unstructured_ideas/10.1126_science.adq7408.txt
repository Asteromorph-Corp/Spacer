H3K9me3 maintenance relies on a positive feedback loop where HP1 recognizes existing modifications and recruits methyltransferase SUV39H1 to methylate adjacent newly incorporated histones, yet this loop requires restriction to prevent excessive heterochromatin formation. An unbiased genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 screen reveals that CUL5 ASB7 E3 ubiquitin ligase functions as a negative regulator by degrading SUV39H1 when recruited to heterochromatin through HP1. During mitosis, CDK1 phosphorylates ASB7, disrupting its interaction with SUV39H1 and allowing SUV39H1 stabilization for H3K9me3 restoration. This dynamic circuit integrates HP1, SUV39H1, and ASB7 to balance the positive feedback mechanism with targeted degradation, creating a regulatory system that maintains H3K9me3 homeostasis through cell cycle-dependent modulation of the ubiquitin ligase activity.
