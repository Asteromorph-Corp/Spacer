Signals from the bone marrow stromal niche engage leukaemia stem-enriched cells during oncogenic progression through specific molecular cues that can be identified by integrating temporal single-cell RNA-sequencing data with human LSC RNA-seq and in vivo CRISPR screens of LSC dependencies. The taurine-taurine transporter axis emerges as a critical dependency because cysteine dioxygenase type 1-driven taurine biosynthesis occurs specifically in osteolineage cells and increases during myeloid disease progression, while TAUT-mediated taurine uptake activates RAG-GTP dependent mTOR signaling and downstream glycolysis in leukaemia stem cells. This dependency can be exploited by blocking CDO1 expression in osteolineage cells or inhibiting TAUT function in leukaemia cells, with TAUT inhibition offering particular promise for overcoming venetoclax resistance in acute myeloid leukaemia through synergistic targeting of both taurine metabolism and anti-apoptotic pathways.
