Dopamine transmission in the basal ganglia operates through G protein-coupled receptors to regulate behavior, but its subcellular effects on striatal function remain unclear. Striatal indirect pathway spiny projection neurons possess dendrites that could receive spatially localized dopamine signals rather than only broad dopamine release. Sparse activation of dopamine release sites can generate discrete dopamine signals that activate D2 receptors in spatially restricted patterns across individual dendrites. D2 receptor signaling may engage multiple downstream pathways with distinct spatiotemporal properties, specifically membrane-delimited Gβγ signaling operating in parallel to intracellular second messenger pathways but across different spatial and temporal scales. This parallel pathway architecture could enable striatal neurons to precisely decode dopamine signals by segregating signaling mechanisms according to their unique spatiotemporal characteristics.
