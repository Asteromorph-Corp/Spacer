FOXA1 mutations occur in a substantial fraction of prostate cancers, yet their oncogenic mechanisms lack in vivo characterization. Knock-in mouse models can represent distinct classes of FOXA1 mutations to enable histopathological and multi-omic analyses of prostate tissues and organoids. Class 1 mutations may drive androgen-dependent adenocarcinomas by co-activating mTORC1/2 and oncogenic AR signaling through chimeric AR-half enhancers when combined with p53 inactivation. Class 2 mutations may reprogram differentiated luminal cells into a progenitor-like state by activating KLF5 and AP-1 neo-enhancer circuitries, thereby inducing intra-luminal plasticity that enables survival and proliferation under castrate androgen levels. This approach exploits the distinct molecular properties of FOXA1 mutational classes to investigate how they divergently drive either prostate tumorigenesis or therapy-resistant progression.
