AlphaFold2's ability to predict protein structures at scale enables systematic analysis of how metabolic function constrains enzyme evolution across deep evolutionary time. Sequence divergence patterns in structurally conserved regions of enzymes catalysing metabolic reactions can reveal the selective pressures operating on different structural elements. Metal ion binding sites, small-molecule-binding sites, and reaction mechanisms each impose distinct evolutionary constraints because they are essential for catalytic function. Surface residues evolve under different selective pressures than buried residues due to their distinct functional roles in protein structure and interaction. Metabolic flux variability and biosynthetic cost create additional selective forces that shape amino acid substitution patterns beyond those imposed by catalytic requirements. The integration of structural biology with evolutionary genomics across hundreds of metabolic pathways in the Saccharomycotina subphylum provides a framework to distinguish how catalytic function, metabolic niche, and network architecture hierarchically govern enzyme evolution.
