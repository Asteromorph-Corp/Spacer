Saccharomyces cerevisiae lacks the multicellular coordination mechanisms found in more complex organisms, limiting its potential for engineering sophisticated collective behaviors. The mating-peptide anchored response system exploits yeast's endogenous G protein-coupled receptor machinery by displaying peptides on cell surfaces to enable direct cell-to-cell communication that mimics natural juxtacrine signaling. Saccharomyces SATURN leverages specific adhesion-protein pairs to create programmable cell aggregation patterns that can be precisely controlled through molecular recognition. These two modular systems can be combined to construct multicellular logic circuits where local cell density and contact patterns drive differential gene expression, recreating the positional information systems that govern developmental programs in multicellular organisms. The integration of contact-dependent signaling with programmable adhesion creates a framework for building user-defined multicellular architectures that respond to their own spatial organization.
