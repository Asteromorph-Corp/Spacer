Influenza viruses replicate their genome within ribonucleoprotein complexes whose three-dimensional architecture remains poorly understood, limiting our knowledge of how the viral polymerase accesses RNA templates during replication. The conserved tail loop of nucleoprotein subunits that connects neighboring subunits through insertion into specific binding pockets provides a structural framework that could reveal the organizational principles of these complexes. Cryo-electron microscopy single-particle analysis combined with cryo-electron tomography can capture the native architecture of ribonucleoprotein complexes and visualize the viral polymerase in different functional states within these structures. The unique ability of these imaging approaches to resolve how polymerase movement relates to ribonucleoprotein architecture through strand sliding mechanisms offers insights into the structural constraints governing RNA template accessibility. The tail loop binding interface represents a conserved structural vulnerability that can be exploited to identify anti-influenza compounds that disrupt ribonucleoprotein assembly.
