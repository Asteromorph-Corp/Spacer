Mitochondrial gene expression remains poorly understood because existing technologies cannot selectively target mitochondrial protein synthesis in living cells. Mitochondria encode essential subunits of the oxidative phosphorylation system through their own genome, making specific manipulation of mitochondrial mRNA translation crucial for understanding how mitochondrial gene expression integrates into cellular physiology. Synthetic peptide-morpholino chimeras can be engineered to silence translation of specific mitochondrial mRNAs when delivered to living human cells. This targeted approach enables comprehensive temporal monitoring of how cells respond to disrupted mitochondrial protein synthesis, providing experimental access to study mitochondrial translation mechanisms that were previously inaccessible in living systems.
