Mitotic onset control through cyclin-dependent kinase activation occurs through spatially distinct regulatory mechanisms that challenge the prevailing cytoplasm-first activation model. Bistability in CDK activation creates irreversible mitotic transitions, but the spatial organization of this bistable response within compartmentalized cells requires investigation through direct observation of activation dynamics in fission yeast. CDK activation initiates in the nucleus rather than the cytoplasm, with nuclear bistable responses driving signal propagation to the cytoplasm through differential response strengths between compartments. Centrosomal cyclin-CDK localization functions as a signal relaying mechanism, since abolishing this localization restricts activation to the nucleus and spatially uncouples nuclear and cytoplasmic mitotic progression. Nuclear proximity to DNA enables integration of incomplete DNA replication and DNA damage monitoring within the CDK control network, establishing a spatiotemporal regulatory framework where distinct regulatory domains in the nucleus and cytoplasm coordinate mitotic onset while preserving genome integrity.
