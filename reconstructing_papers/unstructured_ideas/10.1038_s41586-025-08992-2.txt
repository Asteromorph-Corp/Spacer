DNA methylation patterns in eutherian embryos undergo genome-wide erasure during early development, establishing this as the accepted paradigm for mammalian embryogenesis. The evolutionary conservation of this DNA methylation reprogramming across all mammalian lineages remains unresolved because marsupials represent a divergent mammalian group that separated from eutherians over 160 million years ago. Base-resolution DNA methylation mapping in opossum Monodelphis domestica gametes, embryos, and adult tissues can reveal whether DNA demethylation patterns differ between marsupials and eutherians. The opossum inactive X chromosome and its RSX noncoding RNA provide unique opportunities to examine X inactivation mechanisms that may differ from eutherian Xist-mediated processes. Comparative analysis of gamete differentially methylated regions between marsupials and eutherians can identify conserved versus lineage-specific imprinting mechanisms. The trophectoderm and epiblast represent distinct embryonic compartments where DNA methylation dynamics may reveal tissue-specific reprogramming strategies. This cross-lineage comparison exploits the deep evolutionary divergence between marsupials and eutherians to determine whether genome-wide DNA demethylation represents a universal mammalian developmental requirement or a eutherian-specific innovation.
