Decreased brain CoQ10 levels cause encephalopathy in primary CoQ10 deficiencies and associate with neurodegenerative diseases, yet CoQ10 supplementation fails to increase brain CoQ10 pools. The mammalian CoQ10 headgroup synthesis pathway involves HPDL producing 4-HMA to synthesize the CoQ10 headgroup precursor 4-HB, creating an opportunity to pharmacologically restore CoQ10 synthesis by targeting upstream intermediates rather than the end product. Hpdl-/- mice model the lethal mitochondrial encephalopathy caused by HPDL deficiency, providing a system to test whether 4-HMA or 4-HB supplementation can bypass the enzymatic block and promote CoQ10 headgroup synthesis in vivo. The concept proposes that administering these CoQ10 headgroup intermediates will restore CoQ10 synthesis capacity and rescue the mitochondrial encephalopathy phenotype through mechanistic correction of the underlying biosynthetic defect.
