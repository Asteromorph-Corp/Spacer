Presynaptic homeostatic plasticity represents a conserved adaptive mechanism that maintains synaptic strength across glutamatergic Drosophila neuromuscular junctions, cholinergic mammalian neuromuscular junctions, and glutamatergic mammalian brain synapses despite their evolutionary divergence. The secreted signaling properties of class III semaphorin enable it to function as a trans-synaptic messenger that can coordinate presynaptic and postsynaptic responses across the synaptic cleft. Sema3a's capacity to rapidly induce presynaptic homeostatic plasticity at cholinergic mouse neuromuscular junctions and CA1 hippocampal synapses, including its ability to cross-modally potentiate inhibitory transmission, positions it as a central regulatory molecule for this process. Three-dimensional electron microscopy provides the resolution necessary to visualize Sema3a-dependent ultrastructural changes including active zone expansion and presynaptic stabilization that accompany homeostatic plasticity. The mechanistic framework involves Sema3a promoting vesicle redistribution from non-releasing pools toward recycling and readily releasable pools, with signal transduction requiring PlexinA4 receptor activation and integrin beta-1 co-receptor engagement to execute the presynaptic response.
