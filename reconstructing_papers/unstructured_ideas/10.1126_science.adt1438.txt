Bats harbor numerous zoonotic pathogens whose spillover potential remains poorly understood due to the lack of suitable experimental models that can recapitulate the complex tissue-specific host-pathogen dynamics occurring in natural bat reservoirs. Organoids derived from multiple bat species and organ types can preserve the cellular architecture and physiological responses that determine viral tropism and replication efficiency in different tissues. The concept leverages organoid technology to create a systematic platform spanning five bat species and four organ types, enabling comprehensive analysis of how respiratory, renal, and enteric viruses interact with their natural hosts across species barriers. This multispecies, multiorgan organoid panel approach provides a controlled system for isolating and characterizing bat-borne mammalian orthoreoviruses and paramyxoviruses while simultaneously serving as a testing platform for antiviral drug efficacy against bat virus isolates.
