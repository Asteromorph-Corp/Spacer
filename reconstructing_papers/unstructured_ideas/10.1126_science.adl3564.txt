The genomic diversity characteristic of Brazil's recently admixed population, formed through nonrandom mating patterns concentrated in the 18th and 19th centuries, creates a global haplotype mosaic where ancestry-specific haplotypes distribute unevenly across spatiotemporal dimensions. High-coverage whole-genome sequencing of diverse Brazilian communities spanning urban, rural, and riverine populations can systematically catalog previously unknown variants, including deleterious variants whose frequency correlates with specific ancestry patterns. This comprehensive genomic characterization enables identification of putatively selected genes associated with fertility, immune response, and metabolic traits within the context of Brazil's unique admixture history. The approach leverages the distinctive population structure created by historical demographic events to reveal both the extent of novel genetic variation and signatures of natural selection operating within this globally underrepresented but genomically rich population.
