The molecular complexity of PTSD across multiple perturbed pathways suggests that no single cell type drives the disorder, necessitating a comprehensive cell-type-specific molecular profiling approach. Single-nucleus sequencing of over two million nuclei from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of individuals with and without PTSD enables identification of neuronal and non-neuronal cell-type clusters and their distinct transcriptional responses to trauma. The approach maps gene expression changes and transcriptional regulators across inhibitory neurons, endothelial cells, and microglia to reveal cell-type-specific contributions to glucocorticoid signalling, GABAergic transmission, and neuroinflammation pathways. Cell-type-specific spatial transcriptomics validates the disruption of key genes including SST and FKBP5 within their anatomical contexts. Integration of genetic, transcriptomic, and epigenetic data reveals how credible variants disrupt PTSD-associated genes such as ELFN1, MAD1L1, and KCNIP4 through cell-type-specific regulatory mechanisms, providing a framework to characterize the molecular basis of persistent traumatic stress responses in the human prefrontal cortex.
