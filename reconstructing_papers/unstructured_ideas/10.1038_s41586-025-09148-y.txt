The generation of self-tolerant T cell repertoires requires thymic epithelial cells to express peripheral self antigens and harbor mimetic cells that transcriptionally resemble diverse peripheral tissues, yet the developmental origins and evolutionary basis of this tolerance mechanism remain unclear. Mimetic cells exhibiting muscle, ionocyte, goblet, ciliated, enterohepatic, and keratinocyte signatures emerge through distinct developmental waves that respond differentially to manipulations of thymic epithelial cell progenitor pools via Foxn1 and Ascl1 deletions, hypomorphic FOXN1 variants, and BMP4 and FGF7 overexpression. The vertebrate-specific transcription factor FOXN1 specifically controls postnatal mimetic cell development, while prenatal mimetic cells develop independently of FOXN1 function. Evolutionary replacement of mouse Foxn1 with ancient Foxn1/4 family members from amphioxus and cartilaginous fish reveals that mimetic cell formation represents an ancient mechanism that predates vertebrate emergence, as evidenced by transthyretin-expressing cells in cartilaginous fish thymus and lamprey thymoid. This approach traces the evolutionary expansion of thymic epithelial genetic networks that coordinate peripheral antigen expression with mimetic cell differentiation to establish central tolerance for vertebrate tissue innovations.
