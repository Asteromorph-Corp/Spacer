MAVS functions as an adaptor in antiviral immunity, and GGCX normally operates with a specific membrane topology that would prevent it from accessing cytoplasmic substrates. The research concept exploits the possibility that GGCX can undergo topology inversion to access MAVS in the cytoplasm, where vitamin K-dependent carboxylation by GGCX could modify MAVS function. This carboxylation mechanism is proposed to enhance MAVS-mediated type I interferon induction while suppressing apoptosis, creating a regulatory pathway that connects vitamin K availability to antiviral signaling. The study tests this mechanism by manipulating vitamin K levels through genetic knockout of GGCX, vitamin K-free diets, and warfarin-mediated inhibition of VK epoxide reductase 1 to examine effects on viral susceptibility. The distinctive conceptual twist involves the topology inversion of GGCX enabling cytoplasmic protein carboxylation, representing an unconventional spatial mechanism for vitamin K-dependent post-translational modification.
