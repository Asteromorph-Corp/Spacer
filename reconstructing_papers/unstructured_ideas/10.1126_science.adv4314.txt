BAX monomers translocate from the cytosol to mitochondria during apoptosis where they must oligomerize to permeabilize the outer membrane. The study proposes that a dimer of BAX dimers serves as the basic repeating unit for all BAX oligomeric forms including arcs, lines, and rings. Cryo-electron microscopy at high resolution can reveal the specific interactions within and between these dimers to understand the assembly mechanism. The protruding Î±9 pairs enable end-to-end stacking of repeating units to form various geometric structures including tetragons, pentagons, hexagons, and heptagons with defined numbers of BAX protomers. Missense mutations targeted at the BAX inter-protomer interface can test whether specific molecular contacts are essential for pore formation and proapoptotic function. This approach combines structural determination of BAX oligomers with functional validation through targeted mutagenesis to establish the assembly principle underlying membrane permeabilization.
