Group 3/4 medulloblastoma exhibits complex tumor evolution patterns where large-scale chromosomal aberrations serve as early tumor-initiating events while single-gene oncogenic alterations in MYC, MYCN and PRDM6 arise later as typically subclonal events, though MYC can become clonal during disease progression to drive therapy resistance. Single-cell technologies including single-nucleus RNA sequencing, single-nucleus assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with high-throughput sequencing, and spatial transcriptomics can dissect the interplay between intratumoural heterogeneity, oncogene aberrations, and copy number variation in tumor evolution by analyzing their temporal dynamics and spatial distribution patterns. The cerebellar unipolar brush cell lineage provides the cellular origin for applying population genetics modeling to estimate tumor initiation timing from early gestational development. Spatial transcriptomics reveals subclone distribution patterns across tumor tissue that range from interspersed to clearly segregated arrangements, enabling analysis of how oncogenic events contribute to treatment resistance development.
