TTYH2 possesses structural features that enable membrane protein-mediated lipid transfer between soluble carriers and cellular membranes, while APOE functions as a lipoprotein component that requires unloading after endocytosis. The concept leverages TTYH2's extended domain that faces the endosomal lumen as a binding platform for APOE-containing lipoprotein particles, positioning this interaction to facilitate lipid extraction from lipoproteins and insertion into endosomal membranes. The approach involves characterizing the molecular interaction between TTYH2 and APOE through binding assays and structural studies to define the mechanism by which TTYH2 accelerates lipid transfer during lipoprotein unloading. This framework proposes TTYH2 as a representative of a protein class that bridges the gap between extracellular lipid carriers and intracellular membrane incorporation, exploiting the natural trafficking of APOE-containing lipoproteins through endosomal compartments.
