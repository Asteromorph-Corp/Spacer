A novel approach to study gene expression at subnuclear resolution in single cells combines expansion in situ sequencing with superresolution protein localization. This methodology leverages the physical expansion of tissues to enable in situ sequencing reactions and precise protein localization, allowing the investigation of nuclear architecture. The approach is applied to progeria-derived fibroblasts to study the relationship between lamin proteins, chromatin regulation, transcriptional repressors, nuclear morphology, and gene regulatory changes. This provides a unique system to investigate how nuclear architecture relates to gene regulation, cellular identity, and aging conditions.
