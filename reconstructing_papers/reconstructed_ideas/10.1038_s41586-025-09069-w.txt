The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) requires cytosolic ATP for protein folding and nucleotide sugar synthesis. SLC35B1, an ER-localized SLC transporter, is hypothesized to mediate ATP import into the ER through an ATP/ADP exchange mechanism. This ATP/ADP exchange activity is proposed to supply the ER with ATP while removing ADP. The conceptual basis for this ATP/ADP exchange activity stems from the biochemical necessity of importing ATP into the ER for nucleotide sugar synthesis, coupled with the removal of ADP. The structural basis of SLC35B1's ATP/ADP exchange activity would be determined through high-resolution cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures, capturing the transporter in distinct conformational states. These structures would reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying nucleotide binding and translocation. Additionally, the ATP/ADP exchange activity of SLC35B1 would be biochemically validated through kinetic analysis of ATP and ADP transport.
