Plasmodium falciparum RIFIN proteins are hypothesized to engage both the inhibitory receptor KIR2DL1 and the activating receptor KIR2DS1 on natural killer (NK) cells, potentially modulating NK cell activity. These RIFIN proteins are proposed to mimic host major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules, which are the natural ligands for killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs). By binding to the ligand-binding domains of KIR2DL1 and KIR2DS1, RIFIN proteins may either inhibit or activate NK cells, depending on the specific receptor interaction. This interaction is suggested to occur on the surfaces of infected erythrocytes, where RIFIN proteins are expressed, potentially influencing the immune response to Plasmodium falciparum infection.
