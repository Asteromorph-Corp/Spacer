The interplay between glutamatergic activity and oligodendrocyte precursor cells in gliomas is explored in relation to neuromodulatory circuits. These circuits, originating from specific brainstem regions, including the pedunculopontine nucleus and laterodorsal tegmentum nucleus, which contain cholinergic neurons, are hypothesized to modulate midline glioma growth. This modulation is proposed to occur through acetylcholine release from these neurons. Optogenetic stimulation of these specific neuromodulatory circuits and co-culture systems are employed to assess their circuit-specific effects on tumor growth. Single-cell RNA sequencing identifies the expression of cholinergic receptors, specifically CHRM1 and CHRM3 (M1/M3 receptors), in midline gliomas. Pharmacological approaches using muscarinic receptor antagonists and genetic approaches using shRNA knockdown are utilized to examine the contribution of these receptors to tumor growth.
