Molecular glue degraders induce proximity between E3 ubiquitin ligases, such as CRL4 CRBN, and neosubstrate proteins, leading to their ubiquitination and degradation. The structural basis for CRL4 CRBN substrate recognition involves a β-hairpin G-loop, with VAV1 exemplifying a neosubstrate protein utilizing this G-loop motif. This recognition mechanism suggests that molecular surface mimicry of the β-hairpin G-loop by other proteins may enable their recruitment by CRL4 CRBN. A computational approach to systematically identify proteins containing a similar β-hairpin G-loop within the human proteome is proposed. This approach aims to uncover novel neosubstrate proteins and drug targets, facilitating the design of next-generation molecular glue degraders.
