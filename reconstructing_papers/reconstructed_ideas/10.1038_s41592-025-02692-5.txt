Voltage imaging of neurons in scattering mammalian brain tissues is fundamentally limited by tissue scattering. The concept integrates the temporal sparsity of neural activity, which allows high-speed recording, with localization microscopy, which provides super-resolution. This combination creates a novel imaging approach that overcomes the fundamental limits of widefield microscopy in scattering mammalian brain tissues. The proposed method utilizes light sheet microscopy and the temporal sparsity of neural activity to enable super-resolution localization microscopy of neural voltage activity. This approach is specifically designed to detect small fluorescence changes caused by action potentials and localize their origin in scattering tissues, thus achieving activity localization.
