The thymus, a vertebrate innovation, establishes central tolerance by presenting self antigens through thymic epithelial cells, thereby shaping the T cell repertoire. The evolutionary emergence of this organ involves genetic networks, including Foxn1, Ascl1, BMP4, and FGF7, which are conserved across vertebrates. Investigating the origin of the thymus necessitates examining these genetic networks in jawless vertebrates like lamprey, which lack a thymus but possess T cell-like lymphocytes, and in amphioxus, a pre-vertebrate deuterostome, where transthyretin, a vertebrate thymus gene, is expressed. This comparative approach aims to trace the evolutionary repurposing of genetic networks that led to the development of the thymus and its role in central tolerance.
