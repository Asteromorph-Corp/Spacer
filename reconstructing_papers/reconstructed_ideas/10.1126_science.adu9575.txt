The study focuses on the concept of hippocampal neurogenesis, specifically the characterization of neural progenitor cells. Neural progenitor cells are known to exhibit a range of maturation states. The study proposes to utilize single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) to capture the transcriptomic signatures of individual cells within the human dentate gyrus. The idea is to apply machine learning algorithms to these transcriptomic data to classify neural progenitor cells based on their gene expression profiles. This approach is intended to identify neural progenitor cells, including Ki67+ cells, within adult human tissue.
