The development of an enhancer-AAV toolbox leverages cell-type-specific enhancer sequences to direct transgene expression in striatal neurons. This approach enables selective targeting of medium spiny neurons (MSNs), Sst-Chodl interneurons, Pvalb-Pthlh interneurons, and cholinergic interneurons, allowing precise optogenetic perturbation and multiplex labeling. The enhancer sequences, specifically active in MSNs, facilitate AAV delivery of transgenes, such as those required for direct pathway circuits, in rats and macaques. This cross-species validation provides a versatile method to dissect striatal circuits.
