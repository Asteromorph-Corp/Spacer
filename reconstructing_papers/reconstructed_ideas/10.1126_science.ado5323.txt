The study addresses how heteroprokaryotes contribute to carbon cycling by developing a trait-based ecosystem model that incorporates their functional biogeography. Genetic sequencing is employed to characterize heteroprokaryote communities, informing the model with parameters such as substrate lability and growth strategy. The model integrates copiotrophy and grazing pressure to simulate heteroprokaryote activity. This approach aims to capture their functional biogeography across ocean transects while maintaining data-model consistency.
