Injury induces transcriptional changes in sensory neurons, activating transcription factors such as ATF3 and AP-1. This activation leads to the transcription of promoter-associated GI-SINEs, a family of transposable elements. These GI-SINEs produce mRNAs that are transported into the axons of sensory neurons. Within the axonal cytoplasm, these GI-SINE mRNAs interact with ribosomal proteins and nucleolin, promoting local RNA translation. This translation process is essential for the axonal growth necessary for sensory neuron regeneration.
