The melanocortin system, central to energy homeostasis, operates through melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) signaling in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus. Adenylyl cyclase 3 (AC3), localized to neuronal primary cilia, is integral to ciliary signaling. G protein–coupled receptor 45 (GPR45), a putative Gα s-coupled receptor, is hypothesized to function as a component of the ciliary melanocortin system. This hypothesis suggests that GPR45 regulates energy homeostasis by modulating the activity of MC4R-containing neurons through AC3. The study proposes to test this by identifying missense mutations in GPR45 via mouse germline mutagenesis and assessing their effects on energy homeostasis and ciliary signaling in receptor neurons.
