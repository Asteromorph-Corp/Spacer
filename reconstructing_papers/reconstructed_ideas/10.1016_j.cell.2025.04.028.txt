The spatiotemporal distribution of auxin gradients in plant tissues is regulated by AUX1/LAX transporters, which function as auxin influx carriers. These transporters are key to auxin distribution, yet their structural and functional determinants in Arabidopsis thaliana remain unclear. The AUX1 protein from Arabidopsis thaliana is purified for structural determination using Cryo-EM, focusing on its auxin-unbound states. The structural analysis reveals an inward-facing conformation, providing insight into the transporter's architecture. This structure allows examination of indole-3-acetic acid and 3-chloro-4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid binding, highlighting differences in hydrogen bond coordination. These structural distinctions correlate with the compounds' binding affinity and transport activity, offering a mechanistic understanding of AUX1's role in auxin gradient formation.
