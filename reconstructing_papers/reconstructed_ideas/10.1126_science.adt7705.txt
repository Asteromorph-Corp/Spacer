A chemigenetic sensor, cpFusion, combines the genetically encoded cpGFP with the chemical dye-conjugated cpHaloTag, enabling visualization of protein dynamics. The GRAB strategy employs genetically encoded sensors for real-time tracking of neuromodulator release. A new dopamine sensor, HaloDA1.0, utilizes the HaloTag protein fused to the human dopamine D1 receptor's third intracellular loop, achieving high sensitivity and specificity. This sensor operates in the far-red to near-infrared spectral window, facilitating multiplex imaging with other optical tools. HaloDA1.0 allows simultaneous visualization of dopamine release dynamics and structural brain networks in cultured neurons, brain slices, and behaving animals.
