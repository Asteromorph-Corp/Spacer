The study explores the coordination of BRCA1-BARD1 in DNA double-strand break repair, focusing on its dual regulation of two distinct DNA end resection machineries, EXO1 and the BLM-DNA2 helicase-nuclease complex. It hypothesizes that BRCA1-BARD1's interaction with the CST complex is essential for coordinating these nucleases. The research further investigates how BRCA1-BARD1's role in DNA end resection intersects with the 53BP1 axis, which is critical for repair pathway choice. The study proposes that BRCA1-BARD1-dependent DNA end resection creates unique vulnerabilities in BRCA1-deficient cells. A dual-mechanism approach targeting the nuclease activities of EXO1 and BLM-DNA2, while modulating their signaling networks, is suggested as a strategy to overcome PARP inhibitor resistance in BRCA1-deficient cells.
