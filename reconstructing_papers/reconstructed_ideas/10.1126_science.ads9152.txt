The cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain innervate the olfactory bulb, and their axonal activity could influence odor detection and the performance of olfactory tasks. These cholinergic inputs to the dorsal cortex of the olfactory bulb may modulate granule cell responses, contributing to neural flexibility and sensory modulation, thereby enhancing behavioral performance. Feedback axons from cholinergic neurons in the olfactory bulb to the basal forebrain may carry movement-correlated firing and odor-aligned responses, potentially refining the cholinergic modulation of olfactory processing.
