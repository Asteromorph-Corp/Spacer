The conceptual foundation of CellNEST centers on modeling the spatial positioning of cells and their dynamic cell-cell communication. This model integrates single-cell RNA sequencing data with spatial transcriptomics data to construct a spatial cell-cell communication network. The communication network is built upon ligand-receptor interactions, which form a relay-network that propagates through neighboring cells. This approach allows the identification of signaling cascades, such as those influencing T cell homing to lymph nodes, and can be applied to study lung adenocarcinoma, colorectal cancer, and pancreatic cancer.
