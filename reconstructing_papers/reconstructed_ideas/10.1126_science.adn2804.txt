The study investigates the interplay between mitochondrial redox homeostasis and antioxidant defenses, focusing on the role of ACBD5 and PTPIP51 in mediating peroxisome-mitochondria contact sites. It explores how these contact sites facilitate interorganellar communication, specifically in the context of ROS detoxification and transfer, under oxidative stress conditions. The research aims to elucidate the contribution of the peroxisome lumen to ROS detoxification and its interaction with mitochondria, utilizing a multiorganelle model to understand these processes.
