BRAF mutations constitutively activate the RAS-ERK pathway through disrupting autoinhibition, a process mediated by the kinase domain. The V600E mutation specifically alters this autoinhibition. Cryo-electron microscopy offers a unique approach to capture structural snapshots of oncogenic BRAF mutants in both autoinhibited and active states, as well as in complex with inhibitors. This structural analysis extends to diverse BRAF mutant classes, revealing the conformational changes in the kinase domain and the position of helix Î±C that contribute to constitutive activity. Additionally, the BRAF inhibitor PLX8394 exhibits distinct effects on different BRAF mutants, suggesting that its efficacy is influenced by the specific structural alterations caused by various mutations.
