The unique origin and role of medial ganglionic eminence-derived pallial interneurons (MGE-pINs) in human cortical circuits, particularly their involvement in drug-resistant epilepsy, prompts an investigation into their development and integration. This study proposes generating human MGE-pINs from pluripotent stem cells and transplanting them into xenografted mice to observe their maturation and integration into host cortical circuits. The research focuses on characterizing the expression of somatostatin (SST) and parvalbumin (PVALB), two key markers of MGE-pINs, through a temporal analysis of their transcriptional states using single-nuclei RNA sequencing. Additionally, the study aims to compare the maturation and integration of these interneurons in both healthy and epileptic environments, providing insights into their functional role in the human brain.
