The proposed research idea centers on understanding the interplay between transcription factors and morphogen signaling in generating distinct neuronal subtypes. This investigation begins with pluripotent stem cells, which differentiate into neural progenitors. Morphogen signaling directs these neural progenitors to commit to specific neuronal subtypes through the activation of particular transcription factors. The role of signaling pathways in this process, along with the identification of key transcription factors driving neuronal differentiation, is determined using transcriptomic screening. Single-cell transcriptomics is then employed to map the differentiation trajectories of neurons, revealing dynamic regulon programs that characterize each neuronal subtype.
