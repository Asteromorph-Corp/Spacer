The lateral entorhinal cortex is hypothesized to encode time through neural population activity. The concept posits that the lateral entorhinal cortex exhibits continuous drift in its neural population activity, which is organized along a one-dimensional manifold. This continuous activity drift is proposed to segment experience into discrete events through discrete shifts in population dynamics. These shifts correspond to event boundaries, which parse experience into temporal units with recurring temporal structure. A hierarchical coordinate system, spanning multiple timescales, is proposed to underpin this event organization.
