The research idea investigates the phylogenetic position of Asgard archaea and their relation to eukaryotes using an expanded phylogenomic marker set that combines Asgard and TACK archaeal sequences. It focuses on Heimdallarchaeia and Njordarchaeales to clarify their placement. Ancestral reconstruction and molecular dating of Asgard archaea aim to determine their divergence time and ancestral traits, potentially correlating with the Great Oxidation Event. The study also explores the acetogenic metabolism of Asgard archaea to test the hydrogen hypothesis, which posits an ancestral syntrophic interaction between a Heimdallarchaeia-related archaeon and the protomitochondrion.
