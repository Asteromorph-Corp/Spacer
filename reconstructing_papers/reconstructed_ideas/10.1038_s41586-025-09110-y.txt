The biosynthesis of 4-vinylanisole (4VA), the aggregation pheromone triggering locust swarm formation, is a critical process. A proposed pathway involves the conversion of phenylalanine into cinnamic acid, followed by hydroxylation to 4-hydroxycinnamic acid. Decarboxylation then yields 4-vinylphenol (4VP), which undergoes methylation by 4VPMT1 and 4VPMT2, utilizing S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) as the methyl donor. The X-ray co-crystal structure of 4VPMT2 with SAM and 4-nitrophenol, a competitive inhibitor, reveals the active site's architecture. This structural insight facilitates the rational design of chemical inhibitors targeting the methylation step, thereby disrupting 4VA biosynthesis and potentially controlling locust swarming behavior.
