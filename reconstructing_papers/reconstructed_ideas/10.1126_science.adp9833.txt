Dopamine transmission in the basal ganglia is a key regulator of striatal function. Dopamine signals, acting through D2 dopamine receptors located on the dendrites of spiny projection neurons, modulate striatal function. A central idea is that the spatiotemporal properties of dopamine signals, transmitted via D2 receptors, regulate striatal function by coordinating Gβγ signaling and second messenger pathways in striatal neurons.
