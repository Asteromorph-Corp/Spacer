A study aims to determine how orthosteric ligands alter β1 adrenergic receptor (β1AR) conformational distributions, focusing on high-resolution detection of these changes. The research specifically investigates the conformation of the intracellular face of β1AR, where transducer binding occurs, and how this relates to signaling events. It explores the role of the xWIPF motif and prolines in conformational coupling. The approach employs Paramagnetic nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and 1H-15N NMR to achieve this high-resolution detection, utilizing a nanobody to stabilize a distinct β1AR conformation for detailed analysis.
