A defect in 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase-like protein (HPDL) leads to a neurological disorder characterized by encephalopathy and depletion of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10). This depletion arises from HPDL's role in mitochondrial CoQ10 synthesis, specifically in generating the CoQ10 headgroup precursor 4-hydroxybenzoate (4-HB) from 4-hydroxymandelic acid (4-HMA). Mice with HPDL deficiency model this disorder, exhibiting encephalopathy and CoQ10 depletion. Pharmacological restoration of CoQ10 through supplementation or precursor administration presents a potential therapeutic strategy.
