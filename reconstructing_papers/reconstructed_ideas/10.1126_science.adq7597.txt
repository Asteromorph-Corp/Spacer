Influenza viruses encapsulate their genome in ribonucleoprotein complexes, with viral polymerase replicating RNA templates. The structural organization of these ribonucleoprotein complexes, involving nucleoprotein interactions via tail loop and binding pockets, influences replication mechanisms. Cryo-electron microscopy and its techniques, single-particle analysis and cryo-electron tomography, provide insights into these structural constraints. These methodologies reveal how the ribonucleoprotein complex architecture facilitates viral RNA replication through strand sliding. The structural information from these studies underpins the development of anti-influenza compounds targeting ribonucleoprotein complex assembly.
