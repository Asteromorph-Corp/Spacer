The research idea involves generating oligonucleotide fragments from RNA molecules containing pseudouridine or N1-methylpseudouridine using RNase T2 and PLD exonucleases. These fragments would then be analyzed for their ability to activate TLR7 and TLR8. The study would focus on identifying the chemical features of these modified oligonucleotides that influence their recognition patterns by the Toll-like receptors.
