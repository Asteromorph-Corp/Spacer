Reactive oxygen species accumulation in root nuclei under water stress leads to the oxidation of specific cysteine residues within IAA3. This oxidation induces the redox-dependent multimerization of IAA3, which enhances its interaction with the transcriptional co-repressor TOPLESS. This interaction facilitates the repression of auxin-regulated genes, thereby enabling xerobranching. This proposed mechanism suggests a novel redox-dependent regulation of auxin signaling, distinct from the canonical auxin-mediated degradation of AUX/IAA proteins.
