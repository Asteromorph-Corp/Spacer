Cancer-associated neurons may transfer mitochondria to cancer cells, thereby enhancing their metabolic capacity. This mitochondrial transfer can be observed in nerve-cancer coculture systems and through denervation in cancer models. MitoTRACER and lineage tracing techniques enable the tracking of mitochondrial transfer and the fate of mitochondria from neurons to cancer cells. These approaches allow the assessment of mitochondrial mass in cancer cells across primary tumours and metastatic sites.
