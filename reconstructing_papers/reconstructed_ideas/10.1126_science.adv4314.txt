The study's conceptual framework examines the structural basis of BAX monomer assembly into oligomers on the mitochondrial outer membrane during apoptosis. The research idea proposes to determine the three-dimensional structure of BAX oligomers using cryo-electron microscopy, specifically focusing on how BAX monomers form dimers and assemble into tetragonal, pentagonal, hexagonal, or heptagonal structures. The investigation aims to identify the role of Î±9 pairs in stabilizing BAX protomer arrangements and to characterize the inter-protomer interface through missense mutagenesis. This approach seeks to define the residues critical for BAX oligomerization, pore formation, and subsequent membrane permeabilization, ultimately elucidating the mechanism underlying BAX's proapoptotic function.
