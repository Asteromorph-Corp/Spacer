A research idea aims to systematically map the entire peripheral nervous system in mice. This involves reconstructing the micrometer-scale architecture of the whole peripheral nervous system using blockface volumetric imaging of cleared whole-body mouse specimens. The approach leverages Thy1-EGFP expression to label spinal fibers, complementing with fluorescent protein immunostaining to label sensory projections, motor projections, and sympathetic nerve networks. Additional immunostaining captures perivascular innervation. Viral tracing with adeno-associated virus PHP.eB and canine adenovirus Cre viral vectors labels neural circuits, specifically targeting vagus nerve pathways to reconstruct vagal projections.
