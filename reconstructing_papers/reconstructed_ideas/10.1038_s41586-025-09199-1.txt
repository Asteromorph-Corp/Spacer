A geometric principle organizes the tuning curves of a heterogeneous population of neurons, forming a structured population code geometry. This structured geometry represents dynamic cognitive variables through structured population dynamics. The premotor cortex, a neural structure involved in choice formation, exhibits such structured population code geometry. The dynamic cognitive variables represented by this geometry correspond to the decision variable, which is stabilized by an attractor mechanism.
