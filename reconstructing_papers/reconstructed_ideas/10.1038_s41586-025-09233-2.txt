Adipose tissue undergoes dynamic remodeling during weight loss following obesity, a process that involves distinct cellular mechanisms. The development of a comprehensive single-nucleus atlas of human adipose tissue under these conditions provides a foundation to identify and characterize these mechanisms. This approach enables the direct comparison of adipose tissue between obese and weight loss states, revealing the emergence of senescent metabolic and vascular cells. The study further explores the role of macrophage infiltration and its impact on specific tissue niches, alongside the dynamic cellular behaviors that contribute to tissue injury and repair. Additionally, the research investigates the metabolic flux and bioenergetic cycles that occur during adipose tissue remodeling, offering insights into the cellular processes driving these changes.
