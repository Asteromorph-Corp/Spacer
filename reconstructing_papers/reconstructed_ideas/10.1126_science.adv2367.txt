FOXA1 mutations in prostate cancers drive the progression of androgen-dependent adenocarcinomas, yet the mechanisms underlying their tumorigenic role and contribution to therapy-resistant progression remain unexplored. Genetically engineered knock-in mouse models and organoid systems are proposed to define the functional consequences of FOXA1 mutations. Histopathological and multi-omic analyses of prostate tissues and organoids aim to identify the signaling and transcriptional programs governed by FOXA1 mutations. These programs are hypothesized to involve mTORC1/2-AR signaling crosstalk, AR-half enhancers, and p53 inactivation, which collectively induce a progenitor-like state in luminal cells. This progenitor-like state is proposed to facilitate intra-luminal plasticity, enabling tumorigenesis and therapy-resistant progression under castrate androgen levels through KLF5, AP-1, and neo-enhancer circuitries.
