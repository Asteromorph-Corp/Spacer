The study proposes to investigate the contribution of meiotic errors to chromosomal abnormalities leading to pregnancy loss. This involves utilizing whole-genome sequencing of fetal samples and their parental samples to detect de novo mutations. The research further aims to measure mutation rates in fetal oocytes, which are germ cells, by leveraging existing small sequence variant genotypes of these oocytes as a proxy for mutation rates.
