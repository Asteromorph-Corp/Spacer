The lack of structure in disordered regions of proteins complicates the study of their chemical interactions and bound-state complexes. Molecular simulations, particularly FINCHES simulations, can model the interactions of intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) and generate phase diagrams that elucidate their binding behavior. These simulations can identify interaction hotspots and chemical domains within IDRs. The sequence information of IDRs can be leveraged to develop mechanistic hypotheses about the chemical interaction patterns that dictate their binding specificity.
