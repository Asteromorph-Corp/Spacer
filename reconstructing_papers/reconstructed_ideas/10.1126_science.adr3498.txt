The study proposes to disrupt mitochondrial gene expression in living cells to investigate the relationship between mitochondrial protein synthesis and the oxidative phosphorylation system. This involves employing synthetic peptide-morpholino chimeras to silence the translation of mitochondrial mRNA in human cells. The research idea includes temporal monitoring of the oxidative phosphorylation system's function, offering a dynamic approach to explore mitochondrial translation mechanisms.
