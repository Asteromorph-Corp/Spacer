The research idea proposes that cognitive states, such as decision-making, are associated with neural activity and manifest in behavior through movement patterns. To test this, the study leverages an encoding model framework to examine how neural activity encodes cognitive states. Simultaneously, behavioral variance, such as movement stereotypy, is analyzed to assess cognitive engagement. The temporal structure of movement patterns is proposed to encode cognitive states as an embodied signature. Critically, task-independent movements, which are not required for the task, are considered in this analysis. The study then aligns movement patterns with neural encoding strength to predict behavioral performance.
