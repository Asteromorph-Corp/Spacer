The comprehensive mapping of viral proteomes necessitates a method capable of identifying all translated open reading frames (ORFs) within viral genomes. A technical approach involves the application of massively parallel ribosome profiling to viral genomes. This approach employs nuclease digestion to isolate RNA fragments that are protected by ribosomes during translation. Processing these RNA fragments into a sequencing library using oligonucleotides enables high-throughput sequencing. This methodology allows for the identification of all canonical and noncanonical ORFs within the viral genome, including those overlapping coding sequences and those embedded within regulatory elements.
