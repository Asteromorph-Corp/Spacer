The rapid cell divisions of mammalian embryos during preimplantation development demand accurate chromosome segregation. A specialized mechanism may exist to ensure mitotic fidelity in these early embryos. Nuclear actin cables, which organize prophase chromosomes at the nuclear periphery, could contribute to spindle assembly. Myosin II, which directs actin filament disassembly, might regulate these nuclear actin cables, facilitating spindle assembly. This spindle assembly may initiate prior to nuclear envelope dissolution, potentially differing from conventional pathways.
