{The role of mechanical stimulation in shaping the development of somatosensory neurons is explored by focusing on the mechanically activated ion channel Piezo2. The study examines the consequences of Piezo2 genetic deletion on the mechanotransduction process, the subsequent electrical responses mediated by Nav1.6, and the voltage-dependent transmission of mechanical force. The research further investigates how these mechanical inputs influence the gene expression programs, revealed by single-cell RNA sequencing, that drive the cellular differentiation and morphological maturation of the touch-sensitive structures within the mechanosensory end-organ.}
