The enteric nervous system (ENS) processes luminal nutrients through distinct neuronal pathways. This research idea proposes that specific neurochemically defined ensembles of enteric neurons are activated by luminal nutrients. The experimental approach employs calcium imaging to visualize these activation patterns in live mouse jejunum. Myenteric neurons and submucosal neurons, two major classes of enteric neurons, are considered. The investigation focuses on how serotonin, released from the epithelium upon luminal nutrient exposure, acts as a signaling molecule. This approach examines the activation of myenteric neurons and submucosal neurons along the radial axis of the intestinal wall. The study specifically addresses how these neuronal populations are activated by signaling molecules released from the villus epithelium, which lies in close proximity to the myenteric plexus and submucosal plexus.
