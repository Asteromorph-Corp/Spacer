CRISPR-associated transposases hold promise for RNA-guided DNA integration in human cells as a therapeutic approach for loss-of-function genetic diseases. However, the programmable gene insertion efficiency and specificity of these systems require improvement. Phage-assisted continuous evolution (PACE) with concurrent mutagenesis and selection under evolutionary pressure offers a solution. This method can generate evolved CRISPR-associated transposases capable of inserting kilobase-size DNA cargoes into specific genomic loci, such as safe harbor sites or disease-relevant genes, with minimal off-target effects and indel formation.
