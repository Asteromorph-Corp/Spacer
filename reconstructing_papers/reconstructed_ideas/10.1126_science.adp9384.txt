The concept proposes employing organisms, particularly their enzymes involved in xenobiotic metabolism, to enzymatically transform nanocarbons. This approach specifically utilizes insect systems containing Cytochrome P450 enzymes to metabolize nanocarbons. The goal is to generate novel nanocarbon derivatives through Cytochrome P450-mediated oxygen insertion into their carbonâ€“carbon bonds. This method, termed in-insect synthesis, leverages the insect's inherent metabolic machinery to achieve oxygen insertion into nanocarbon aromatic ring structures.
