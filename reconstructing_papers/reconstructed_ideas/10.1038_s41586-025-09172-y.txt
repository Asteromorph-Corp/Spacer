The study explores the bistable nature of CDK activation and its spatial organization between the nucleus and cytoplasm in fission yeast. It investigates how this spatial organization coordinates DNA replication, DNA damage responses, and mitotic onset. The research focuses on how CDK activation's bistability and spatial organization ensure signal propagation between these processes, maintaining genome integrity.
