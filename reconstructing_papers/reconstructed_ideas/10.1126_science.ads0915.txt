Mobile integrons, by capturing and rearranging gene cassettes, allow bacteria to adjust the adaptive value of their defense mechanisms. The ability to combinatorially assemble different combinations of these cassettes, each encoding distinct resistance functions, provides a strategic advantage. The order of cassettes within the integron critically influences the associated fitness costs, enabling bacteria to construct reconfigurable defense systems against antimicrobial agents and bacteriophages. This ordered cassette arrangement allows bacteria to tune the costs of defense mechanisms, thereby optimizing their adaptive value under different selective pressures.
