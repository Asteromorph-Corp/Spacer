DRT9 is a reverse transcriptase functioning as an antiphage defense system through abortive infection. Its activity is dATP-dependent, requiring the host NrdAB ribonucleotide reductase complex for dATP supply. The DRT9 reverse transcriptase generates cDNA, which interacts with the host SSB protein to interfere with viral replication. The hexameric complex structure of NrdAB is determined by cryo-electron microscopy. The antiphage activity of DRT9 involves nucleic acid interference, particularly through interactions with ncRNA.
