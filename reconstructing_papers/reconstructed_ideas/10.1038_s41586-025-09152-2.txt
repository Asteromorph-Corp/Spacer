The nuclear body protein SP140 is hypothesized to play a role in the post-transcriptional regulation of interferon-β (IFN-β) during antiviral responses. This idea suggests SP140 stabilizes Ifnb1 mRNA, counteracting the mRNA decay activity of the RNA-binding protein tristetraprolin (TTP) and the associated CCR4–NOT complex. This proposed stabilization of Ifnb1 mRNA by SP140 may contribute to antiviral effector-triggered immunity, with implications for viral replication in the context of MHV68 infection.
