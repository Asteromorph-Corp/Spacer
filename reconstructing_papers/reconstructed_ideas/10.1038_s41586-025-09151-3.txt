Human pluripotent stem cell-derived brain organoids recapitulating the developing telencephalon are imaged using light-sheet microscopy to track dynamic tissue morphology and cellular behaviors. A dual-channel labeling approach, with computational demultiplexing, enables visualization of subcellular actin and tubulin features. Single-cell transcriptome analysis of these organoids reveals cellular heterogeneity. This combined approach captures dynamic lumen expansion within the neuroepithelium. The study further investigates how the extracellular matrix contributes to these dynamic tissue behaviors through mechanosensing, and how extrinsic matrix factors influence intrinsic WNT and Hippo signalling pathways, including WNT ligand secretion.
