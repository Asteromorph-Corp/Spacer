Bacteria employ the Type VI Secretion System (T6SS) to lyse neighboring cells, releasing nutrients, a process particularly vital under starvation conditions. The concept proposes tracking the transfer of these nutrients from lysed cells to neighboring bacteria using isotopic markers and single-cell live imaging. This approach specifically investigates how antagonistic bacteria, equipped with a distinct metabolic gene repertoire, assimilate these nutrients, potentially influencing their survival and interactions within microbial communities.
