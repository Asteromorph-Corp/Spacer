Interferon-Î³, a key pro-inflammatory cytokine, induces immunoproteasome subunit PSMB8 expression in neurons. This elevated PSMB8 expression reduces proteasome activity, thereby increasing PFKFB3 levels, which directs glucose metabolism towards glycolysis instead of the pentose phosphate pathway. This metabolic shift diminishes the production of NADPH, leading to oxidative stress and subsequent ferroptosis. This mechanism contributes to neurodegeneration in multiple sclerosis and other neurodegenerative diseases.
