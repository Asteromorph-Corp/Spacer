The study explores the potential of bone marrow transplantation in addressing central nervous system (CNS) pathology arising from CSF1R mutations, a specific cause of microgliopathy. This approach investigates the ability of bone marrow-derived cells to cross the blood-brain barrier and repopulate the brain with microglia, aiming to restore normal microglial function and reverse the CNS pathology associated with CSF1R-related microgliopathy.
