The antennal lobe's three-dimensional glomerular map presents a challenge for axons to navigate and find their postsynaptic partners. This study proposes that the three-dimensional glomerular map is first simplified into one-dimensional projections through a process of dimensional reduction. Olfactory receptor neuron axons then follow an arc-shaped trajectory along these one-dimensional projections to reach their correct glomerular positions based on olfactory receptor neuron type. This dimensional reduction and the resulting axon trajectory significantly constrain the search space, facilitating the matching of olfactory receptor neuron axons with their postsynaptic partner projection neuron dendrites.
