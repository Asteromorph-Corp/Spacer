The complex paclitaxel biosynthetic pathway, found in yew trees (Taxus), has not been fully elucidated. RNA-sequencing and co-expression analyses can identify candidate biosynthetic genes. Multiplexed perturbation and single nuclei transcriptional profiling can resolve distinct cell states and expression modules that coordinate subpathways. Specific candidates, including a nuclear transport factor, FoTO1, and a Î²-phenylalanine-CoA ligase, can be functionally tested. These genes can be expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana to produce the key paclitaxel intermediate baccatin III through heterologous expression.
