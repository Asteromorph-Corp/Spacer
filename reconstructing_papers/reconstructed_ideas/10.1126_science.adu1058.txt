Adenylate kinase, a model enzyme with known domain architecture and catalytic function, serves as a system to evaluate the effects of sequence variants. The catalytic parameters kcat and KM, which directly quantitate catalytic function, are measured for these sequence variants using microfluidic technology, enabling high-throughput measurement. These measurements produce sequence-catalysis landscapes. To predict catalytic parameters from sequence, semisupervised models are trained using protein language models, which capture evolutionary information, and structural information derived from the known domain architecture.
