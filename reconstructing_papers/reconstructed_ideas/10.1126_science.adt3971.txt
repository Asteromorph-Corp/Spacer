Emotional responses in mammalian species, including humans, are linked to neural mechanisms. Affective behavioral measurements can be used to track these emotional responses during clinical medication development. Intracranial electrophysiology can reveal specific neural patterns that encode emotional processing. The study of these neural patterns during emotional processing could uncover biphasic patterns in sensory signals and their temporal components. The temporal components of emotional processing can be characterized by persistent dynamics, which can then be linked to a global intrinsic timescale and distributed neural context.
