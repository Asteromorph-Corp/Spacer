The research idea centers on the adaptation of CO2-reducing hydrogenotrophic methanogens to nickel-limited conditions through a nickel-independent methanogenesis pathway. This pathway involves the Fe-hydrogenase Hmd, F420-dependent proteins, and the Elp–Hdr complexes. The study focuses on Methanothermobacter marburgensis, aiming to establish that the Fe-hydrogenase Hmd, in conjunction with F420-dependent proteins and the Elp–Hdr complexes, forms a functional, nickel-independent methanogenesis pathway.
