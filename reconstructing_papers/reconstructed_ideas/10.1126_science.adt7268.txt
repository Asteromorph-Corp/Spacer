The research idea involves creating a protein scaffold designed to house a synthetic porphyrin cofactor. This design incorporates a histidine residue positioned to coordinate with the heme ligand, forming a novel active site. The synthetic heme is engineered to perform catalytic transformations, such as cyclopropanation through carbene intermediates, enabling stereoselective carbon-carbon bond formation. Additionally, the system aims to facilitate silicon-hydrogen insertion reactions. Directed evolution within whole cells optimizes the protein's catalytic efficiency. The computational design process strategically positions proline residues within Î± helices to achieve the desired conformation. This approach employs molecular dynamics simulations to model the protein's conformational ensembles, ensuring accurate structural predictions.
