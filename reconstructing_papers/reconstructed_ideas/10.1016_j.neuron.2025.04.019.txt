The comorbidity of chronic visceral pain and emotional disorders like anxiety is common, but their neural mechanisms and developmental origins remain unclear. Prenatal maternal stress (PMS) is hypothesized to contribute to the co-development of visceral hypersensitivity and anxiety-like behaviors. This research idea proposes that PMS activates two distinct neural circuits involving different paraventricular thalamus (PVT) subregions. Specifically, the anterior PVT (aPVT) glutamatergic neurons projecting to the basolateral amygdala (BLA) mediate visceral hypersensitivity through increased Cacna1e expression. Conversely, the posterior PVT (pPVT) glutamatergic neurons projecting to the central amygdala (CeA) mediate anxiety-like behaviors via Grin2a upregulation.
