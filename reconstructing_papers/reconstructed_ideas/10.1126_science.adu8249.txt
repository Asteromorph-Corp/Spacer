The proposed research idea investigates how gene expression patterns in homologous cells evolve across species. This approach employs single-cell RNA sequencing to track gene expression in homologous cells during Caenorhabditis elegans and C. briggsae embryogenesis, with a focus on embryonic lineage. This methodology enables the examination of gene expression patterns at a cellular resolution, allowing the identification of conserved and diverged spatiotemporal developmental patterns. The study aims to identify conserved gene expression patterns, which may indicate developmental constraints, and diverged patterns, which could reflect evolutionary changes in developmental processes.
