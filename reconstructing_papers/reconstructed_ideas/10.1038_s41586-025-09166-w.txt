Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infects both epithelial cells and B cells, but the entry process differs between these cell types. In B cells, EBV entry involves the interaction of the viral glycoprotein gp42 with human leukocyte antigen class II molecules. However, epithelial cells lack this specific interaction, suggesting that EBV must utilize alternative glycoproteins for entry. This study compares the entry of EBV into epithelial cells and B cells by examining the role of specific EBV glycoproteins, including the gH/gL complex and gp42, and their potential interactions with cellular receptors such as R9AP and EPHA2. The approach involves analyzing the expression levels of these glycoproteins in epithelial cells compared to B cells, and using peptides or monoclonal antibodies like AMMO1 to block their interactions with host receptors.
