The proposed research investigates the interaction between the membrane protein TTYH2 and APOE-containing lipoprotein particles within endosomes. The study seeks to determine if TTYH2 facilitates lipid transfer from these extracellular lipid carriers to the intracellular membrane incorporation process. To achieve this, the research will employ binding assays to test the interaction between TTYH2 and APOE, alongside structural studies to elucidate how TTYH2 may mediate lipid transfer from APOE-containing lipoprotein particles. The work focuses on understanding this process specifically within the endosomal lumen.
