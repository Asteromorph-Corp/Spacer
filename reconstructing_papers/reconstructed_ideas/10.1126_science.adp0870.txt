The central hypothesis posits that the calcium sensor synaptotagmin-1 (Syt1) and Syt2, which exhibit distinct calcium affinity and cooperativity, confer unique calcium dependency to release machinery, enabling adaptation to diverse calcium conditions. This hypothesis is explored in two distinct neuronal systems: the high release probability synapses of Layer 5 pyramidal neurons and the lower release probability Purkinje cell synapses. The proposed research employs laser photolysis of caged calcium to achieve rapid and precise calcium elevations, allowing for the analysis of calcium-dependent vesicle fusion. The resulting data are incorporated into kinetic models to differentiate the contributions of calcium affinity and cooperativity in synaptotagmin-mediated calcium sensing.
