The research idea involves creating a computational enzyme designed with a TIM-barrel fold, constructed from backbone fragments derived from natural TIM-barrel proteins. This computational enzyme is specifically targeted for the Kemp eliminase reaction. The approach introduces mutations into the active site to optimize catalytic residues, thereby enhancing catalytic efficiency. This process is achieved through mutant-library screening, which identifies the most efficient variants. Furthermore, stabilizing mutations are incorporated into the computational enzyme to ensure its stability, making it suitable for practical applications in biocatalysis.
