Studying bat-borne zoonotic pathogens requires experimental models to investigate host-pathogen dynamics and spillover. Bats, as natural reservoirs, can harbor these pathogens. Organoids, which are three-dimensional cell cultures, provide a system to examine viral tropism and replication efficiency. A systematic platform is needed to compare different bat species and organ types. Such a platform would allow the study of respiratory, renal, and enteric viruses, and assess species barriers. This systematic approach would enable the investigation of mammalian orthoreoviruses and paramyxoviruses in bat organoids. Additionally, this platform could test antiviral drug efficacy against these viruses. The use of bat virus isolates would ensure the authenticity of the experimental models.
