The unresolved fraction of rare genetic diseases with exome sequencing is hypothesized to involve pathogenic non-coding promoter variants. These promoter variants can be identified through exome sequencing data, and PromoterAI, a deep neural network-based tool, predicts their impact on gene expression. The approach involves identifying the pathogenic variation in promoter regions, linking this variation to outlier expression in RNA and protein levels, and validating the gene expression regulation of these variants through reporter assays.
