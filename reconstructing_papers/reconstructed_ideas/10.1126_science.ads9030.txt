The research idea centers on understanding the catalytic mechanism of peptide release factors, which hydrolyze peptidyl-tRNA upon binding to stop codons on ribosomes. This mechanism is hypothesized to involve the prepeptide release state of the ribosome, where the ester bond of peptidyl-tRNA is positioned in proximity to the catalytic site. The conformation of the A76 ribose of the tRNA's 3'-terminal adenosine, specifically its C2'-endo and C3'-endo pucker states, is proposed to contribute to the conformational flexibility necessary for this positioning. This flexibility allows the ester bond to adopt a conformation that facilitates hydrolysis, potentially through an intramolecular nucleophilic mechanism, rather than an intermolecular hydrolysis mechanism.
