The study of genome regulation in non-bilaterian animals, including sponges, ctenophores, placozoans, cnidarians, and early branching holozoans such as ichthyosporeans, filastereans, and choanoflagellates, presents a unique opportunity to explore the evolution of genome architecture. By employing chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) and epigenomic profiling, this research investigates the relationships between chromatin compartmentalization, chromatin looping, and genome architecture. The investigation focuses on understanding how these architectural features relate to gene expression and their potential role in animal evolution.
