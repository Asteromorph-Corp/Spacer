G-quadruplexes in DNA, formed during transcription, induce replication fork stalling by generating co-transcriptional G-loops. These structures activate ATM and ATR kinases, which mediate repair of stalled replication forks. BRCA2 and RAD51 proteins facilitate homology-directed invasion at these stalled sites. The DHX36-FANCJ helicases resolve G4 structures to prevent replication fork stalling. These processes collectively maintain genome stability through transcriptional regulation and the resolution of replication stress.
