The pentaploid dogroses, despite their five chromosome sets, form bivalents and univalents during female meiosis. This research idea posits that generating haplotype-resolved genome assemblies will phase the five subgenomes of pentaploid dogroses, thereby distinguishing between highly homozygous and divergent chromosome sets. The study aims to clarify the homology relationships between these subgenomes by examining chromosome synteny and phylogenetic relationships. Additionally, analyzing the meiotic behaviors of the five subgenomes during female meiosis and pollen genome analysis will be conducted. The research further focuses on identifying unique centromere structural bimodality through ATHILA retrotransposons and tandem-repeat-based structures.
