Cellular heterogeneity arises from DNA replication errors and DNA damage, which generate heritable mutational and epigenetic signatures. To investigate this, endogenously fluorescently labelled proteins for DNA replication and DNA lesions can be tracked in live single cells. CRISPR-based genome editing introduces these labels, allowing the construction of lineage trees that link cell cycle progression, DNA damage, and sister cell asymmetry. Subsequent single-cell transcriptomics then connects these dynamic features to the molecular states of individual cells. Introducing oncogenic perturbations and polyploidization further explores their influence on cellular heterogeneity and genome integrity.
