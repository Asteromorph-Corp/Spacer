Medulloblastoma, a pediatric brain tumor, exhibits intratumoural heterogeneity driven by chromosomal aberrations. Such aberrations include amplifications of oncogenes MYC and MYCN and deletions involving PRDM6. The study aims to understand the role of these chromosomal aberrations in driving intratumoural heterogeneity and their contribution to treatment resistance. It combines single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq), ATAC-seq, and spatial transcriptomics to profile chromosomal aberrations and their spatial expression patterns. This approach allows the detection of copy number variations (CNV) and their association with gene expression at single-cell resolution. Population genetics modeling will then track the emergence and selection of specific oncogenic aberrations during tumor evolution, providing insights into their role in treatment resistance.
