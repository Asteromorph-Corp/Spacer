The study investigates the potential essential metabolic functions of the anti-apoptotic protein MCL-1 during embryogenesis, separate from its role in apoptosis regulation. Previous work demonstrates that MCL-1 knockout embryos die early in development. However, genetic replacement of MCL-1 with other anti-apoptotic proteins BCL-XL or BCL-2 fails to rescue the developmental failure, indicating that MCL-1's non-apoptotic functions are critical. The research aims to determine if MCL-1's essential role in embryogenesis is linked to its metabolic functions, independent of its anti-apoptotic activity. This investigation will test whether the developmental failure of MCL-1 knockout embryos stems from metabolic deficiencies, rather than a lack of anti-apoptotic activity.
