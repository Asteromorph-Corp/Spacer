The neural circuits connecting the ventral CA1 (vCA1) and dorsal CA2 (dCA2) of the hippocampus with the medial amygdala (MeA) are hypothesized to encode social memory through the formation of engrams. The idea proposes to identify these engram neurons using immediate early gene labeling and test their sufficiency for social memory recall through optogenetic reactivation. This research further aims to compare and contrast the role of rate coding and theta-based temporal coding mechanisms in these circuits, with a particular focus on how these coding schemes relate to the valence and sex-specific aspects of social memory. The study will also employ selective ablation of these engram neurons to assess their necessity in social memory processes, ultimately positing a dual neural coding framework for social memory.
