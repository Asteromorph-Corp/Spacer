The nucleolus, a biomolecular condensate, organizes ribosomal RNA (rRNA) maturation steps into spatially distinct compartments. To understand how this spatial organization coordinates small subunit (SSU) processing and large subunit (LSU) precursor formation, a research approach integrates sequencing and imaging. This approach tracks rRNA transcripts while analyzing nucleolar structural organization. Introducing an rDNA plasmid perturbs nucleolar organization, enabling investigation into how phase ordering within the condensate influences distinct rRNA maturation steps.
