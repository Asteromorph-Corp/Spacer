{The research idea centers on Borrelia recurrentis, a human-restricted louse-borne spirochete. A comprehensive study of B. recurrentis genomes, including those from archaeological samples, will provide a unique opportunity to analyze genome reduction and vector specialization. The ancient DNA from these samples will allow for phylogenetic and pan-genome analysis, revealing gene loss and plasmid evolution. This approach will clarify the evolutionary timeline of B. recurrentis, tracing its adaptation from a tick-borne ancestor to a strictly louse-borne pathogen.}
