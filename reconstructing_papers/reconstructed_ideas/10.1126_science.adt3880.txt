The study explores how chromosomal rearrangement within *Yersinia pestis* impacts gene dosage of the *pla* gene located on the pPCP1 plasmid, and how this alteration in gene dosage affects the virulence and mortality associated with bubonic plague. The research specifically investigates whether increased dosage of *pla* leads to enhanced lethality of *Yersinia pestis*. Additionally, the study examines whether fragmentation of rodent populations, a natural experiment, serves as an adaptive response influencing this gene dosage effect and subsequent disease outcomes.
