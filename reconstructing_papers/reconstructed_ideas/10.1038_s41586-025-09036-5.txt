The research idea centers on the role of connective tissue cells' positional memory in salamander limb regeneration, specifically focusing on the transcription factor Hand2 and Shh signaling. Hand2 and Shh signaling form a positive-feedback loop in posterior cells, maintaining Hand2 expression. The idea posits that creating an ectopic Hand2-Shh positive-feedback loop in anterior cells can reprogram their positional memory. This reprogramming involves transiently exposing anterior cells to a factor that activates Hand2 expression, thereby initiating Shh signaling, which in turn sustains Hand2 expression through the positive-feedback loop.
