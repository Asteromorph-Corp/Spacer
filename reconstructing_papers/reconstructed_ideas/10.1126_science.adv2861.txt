Zinc finger proteins (ZFPs) are transcription factors that bind DNA through zinc finger domains. Zincore is a ZNF-specific coregulator that associates with DNA-bound zinc finger domains, facilitating the formation of a protein complex that regulates transcription. The arginine clamp in DNA-bound zinc finger domains specifically mediates the interaction with Zincore. For example, ZFP91 binds the CTTTAAR promoter motif through its zinc finger domains, and the arginine clamp in these DNA-bound zinc finger domains interacts with Zincore to regulate QRICH1 and SEPHS1 transcription.
