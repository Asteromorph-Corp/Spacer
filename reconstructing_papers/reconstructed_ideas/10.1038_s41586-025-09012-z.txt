Leptomeningeal metastasis (LM) involves cancer cells in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and central nervous system (CNS) membranes. The role of IFNγ in LM remains undefined. This research idea proposes utilizing mouse models of LM to overexpress IFNγ in the CSF using adeno-associated-virus (AAV) delivery of Ifng. The study aims to determine whether T cells, natural killer cells, myeloid cells, or dendritic cells in the CSF are responsible for the observed effects of IFNγ overexpression. Additionally, it seeks to identify the specific myeloid cells and dendritic cells in the CSF that respond to IFNγ, particularly focusing on their antigen presentation capabilities. The research also examines the potential migration of CCR7+ dendritic cells out of the CSF and explores how IFNγ influences inflammatory responses in this compartmentalized environment.
