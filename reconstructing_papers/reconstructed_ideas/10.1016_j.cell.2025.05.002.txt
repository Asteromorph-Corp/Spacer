The cortex's diverse cell types are characterized by distinct transcriptomic and epigenomic profiles. These profiles reveal marker genes and enhancers unique to specific cortical subclasses. Such enhancers, identified through epigenomic analysis, are utilized to create enhancer libraries. These libraries enable the generation of driver lines and reporter lines, which facilitate cell-type-specific transgene expression. Additionally, AAV vectors are employed to deliver these enhancer elements for targeted transgene expression. Together, these approaches provide tools for precise experimental manipulation of specific cortical cell types.
