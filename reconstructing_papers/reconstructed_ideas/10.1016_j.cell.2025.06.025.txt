Saccharomyces cerevisiae can be engineered to form structured multicellular systems through synthetic adhesion-protein pairs. These synthetic adhesion-protein pairs, derived from the SATURN system, enable cell aggregation by molecular recognition. The multicellular coordination of these synthetic cells can be programmed through multicellular logic circuits, which encode spatial organization and positional information. These logic circuits integrate contact-dependent signaling with other modes of cell-cell communication, such as cell density-dependent gene expression, to direct the formation of distinct multicellular architectures.
