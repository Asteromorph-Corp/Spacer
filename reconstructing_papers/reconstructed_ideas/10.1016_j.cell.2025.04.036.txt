The study explores the interplay between environmental stress, specifically cold stress, and the regulation of gene expression through epigenetic pathways in rice. It focuses on cold stress-induced DNA hypomethylation in the ACT1 promoter, which creates an epiallele associated with cold tolerance. The research proposes that targeted methylation editing can replicate this hypomethylation, thereby generating a novel epiallele. This approach aims to establish a Lamarckian inheritance model for cold tolerance, demonstrating how methylation-mediated gene regulation can be harnessed to confer adaptive traits in rice.
