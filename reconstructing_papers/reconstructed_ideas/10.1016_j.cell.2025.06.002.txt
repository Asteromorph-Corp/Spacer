Vascular dementia (VaD) is modeled by inducing focal ischemia in mice. A transcriptomic analysis using single-nucleus RNA sequencing is performed to identify intercellular signaling pathway disruptions. A ligand-receptor database is utilized to pinpoint specific ligand-receptor interactions. Among these interactions, Serpine2-Lrp1 interactions in oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC) and CD39-A3AR signaling in OPC emerge as key findings. Serpine2 manipulation and A3AR agonism are then performed to validate their specific roles in promoting OPC repair.
