The extensive genomic diversity found in admixed populations, such as those in Brazil, arises from their haplotype mosaic, which comprises numerous ancestry-specific haplotypes. This study leverages whole-genome sequencing data to comprehensively map these ancestry-specific haplotypes, enabling the tracking of deleterious variants across distinct ancestries. By integrating haplotype-based ancestry information with the distribution of deleterious variants, this research elucidates how natural selection and historical demographic events, including the timing of admixture and changes in population size, have shaped patterns of genetic variation.
