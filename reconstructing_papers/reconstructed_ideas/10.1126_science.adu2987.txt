Tellurium nanowire networks (TeNWNs) are proposed as a nanoprosthesis, positioned subretinally to interact with retinal neural circuits. The TeNWNs exhibit photoresponsivity to near-infrared-II (NIR-II) light, enabling them to convert this specific optical input into electrical signals. Engineered asymmetries within the TeNWNs are designed to enhance the light-to-electrical signal conversion across a broad spectrum. This conversion capability allows the TeNWNs to provide precise electrical stimulation to retinal neural circuits, aiming to restore photoreceptor function.
