Sleep deprivation leads to a period of recovery sleep, during which neuronal circuits undergo changes. The nucleus reuniens, a thalamic nucleus, is involved in presleep behaviors. Optogenetic stimulation of the nucleus reuniens, combined with sleep deprivation, alters the duration of recovery sleep. The zona incerta, a subthalamic region, is functionally linked to the nucleus reuniens through the thalamic-zona incerta pathway. This pathway exhibits dynamic synaptic connectivity and plasticity, potentially driving the homeostatic mechanisms underlying recovery sleep.
