Diapause, a developmental arrest in insects, is regulated by specific causal loci. The CYCLE protein, known for its role in circadian rhythms, possesses structural variations in its N terminus. Genome-wide association analysis of genetic variants in silk moth strains, including polyvoltine strains with distinct diapause characteristics, identifies a novel isoform of the CYCLE protein. This isoform, influenced by structural variations in its N terminus, alters developmental timing and circadian rhythms, contributing to adaptive phenotypes. This research explores how these protein variants in the CYCLE protein provide evolutionary flexibility to regulate diapause.
