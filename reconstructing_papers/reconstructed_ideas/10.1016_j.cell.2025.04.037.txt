The study presents a method to capture dynamic DNA-protein interactions within living cells. This approach employs photo-crosslinking to covalently link proteins to DNA, forming peptide-nucleotide crosslinks that preserve the native protein-DNA interfaces. This technique allows the identification of proteins that interact with DNA, including transcription factors and DNA repair proteins, and enables the mapping of DNA interactomes. The method also provides insights into chromatin accessibility and genomic regulation.
