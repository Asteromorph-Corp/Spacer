The concept proposes to address gastrointestinal motility disorders, such as achalasia and gastroparesis, which arise from nitric oxide deficiency in the enteric nervous system. The idea involves generating human nitric oxide neurons through directed differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells. This approach seeks to identify specific growth factors and small molecules that promote nitric oxide neuron specification, aiming to generate functional human pluripotent stem cell-derived nitric oxide neurons. These neurons would then be utilized to screen drug libraries, create human tissue models, test their function following transplantation into mouse models, and ultimately develop a therapeutic approach for these motility disorders.
