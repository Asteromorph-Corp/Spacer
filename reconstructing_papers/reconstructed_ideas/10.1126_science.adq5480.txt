Norepinephrine, a neuromodulatory signal, engages astrocytic adrenergic receptors, initiating calcium dynamics. This astrocytic calcium signaling facilitates the release of adenosine 5â€²-triphosphate (ATP), which in turn activates neuronal A1 adenosine receptors. The activation of these A1 adenosine receptors modifies presynaptic efficacy. These astrocyte-dependent mechanisms, combined with norepinephrine's direct neuromodulatory actions, collectively regulate synaptic function and circuit functional connectivity.
