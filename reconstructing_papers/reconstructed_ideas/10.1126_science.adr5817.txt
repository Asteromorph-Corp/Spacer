Telomerase ribonucleoprotein is hypothesized to form a dimeric structure. The dimerization interface is proposed to play a central role in its function. Protein-protein interactions within the telomerase ribonucleoprotein dimer are thought to stabilize the complex. Cryo-EM structure determination is aimed to visualize the structural details of this dimer, including the dimerization interface and telomeric DNA binding regions. Mutations in telomerase ribonucleoprotein linked to aging diseases are proposed to disrupt these interactions, leading to compromised telomere maintenance.
