Ketamine is a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist with rapid antidepressant effects that are associated with the induction of synaptic potentiation. This synaptic potentiation specifically occurs at CA3-CA1 synapses, a process that is independent of NMDA receptor activation. The underlying molecular mechanism involves dual-specificity phosphatase 6 (DUSP6), which deactivates extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling. This ERK signaling is part of a critical intracellular signaling cascade that is activated by tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) signaling in excitatory neurons. The regulation of ERK signaling by DUSP6 is essential for the synaptic and behavioral responses to ketamine, and it determines the therapeutic window of ketamine's antidepressant effects.
