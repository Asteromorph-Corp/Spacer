Chimeric antigen receptor T cells are generated through *in vivo* reprogramming, where lipid nanoparticles deliver messenger RNA to specific T cell subsets. The lipid nanoparticle formulation is designed to selectively transfect CD8+ T cells by targeting T cell surface markers. The mRNA constructs encode chimeric antigen receptor proteins, which are then expressed on the surface of CD8+ T cells. These chimeric antigen receptors enable the CD8+ T cells to recognize specific antigens and generate cytotoxic responses.
