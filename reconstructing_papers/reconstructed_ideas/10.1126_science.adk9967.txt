The study proposes that MAVS undergoes topology inversion into the cytoplasm where it becomes a substrate of the enzyme GGCX. This process requires vitamin K-dependent carboxylation of MAVS, a modification essential for its ability to induce type I interferon and apoptosis. The anticoagulant warfarin, which blocks VK epoxide reductase 1, inhibits this carboxylation process, leading to diminished antiviral immunity and increased viral susceptibility.
