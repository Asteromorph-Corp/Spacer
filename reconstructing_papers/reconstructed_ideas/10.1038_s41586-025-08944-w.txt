The study seeks to examine the Cambrian jawless vertebrate Anatolepis through synchrotron scanning of its fossils to identify dentine tubules within their exoskeleton. This ultrastructural analysis is then compared with the sensory sensilla of an aglaspidid arthropod exoskeleton to explore morphological convergence between these structures. Additionally, the research proposes examining the odontodes of chondrichthyans and teleosts via immunofluorescence analysis to assess their innervation patterns. These combined approaches aim to establish a potential sensory function for the dentine tubules in Anatolepis and to investigate the convergent evolution of sensory structures between disparate groups. The study ultimately seeks to trace the evolutionary origins of dentine tissue and explore the coevolution of sensory structures and dentine.
