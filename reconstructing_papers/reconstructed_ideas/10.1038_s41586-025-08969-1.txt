The study explores the distinct brain regions involved in consolidating motor memories. Mice are trained to associate a visual cue with forelimb reaching for a food pellet, a task requiring sensory-motor associations. Following training, optogenetic inhibition of either the striatum or the visual cortex during memory consolidation is employed. This approach allows examination of how trial-to-trial improvements in forelimb reaching behavior, indicative of motor memory consolidation, are impacted. The research aims to determine whether these two brain regions independently support the formation of motor memories, thereby proposing the concept of dual encoding during memory consolidation.
