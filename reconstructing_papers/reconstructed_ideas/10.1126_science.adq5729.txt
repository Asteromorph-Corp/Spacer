Astrocytes, central to brain function, remain understudied in their role of integrating adrenergic signaling to modulate neuronal circuit activity and behavior. The proposed research hypothesizes that Drosophila astrocytes utilize adrenergic receptors to sense neurotransmitters and subsequently modulate neuronal circuit activity. This study aims to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying this gating function in Drosophila and to assess its conservation in mammalian astrocytes.
