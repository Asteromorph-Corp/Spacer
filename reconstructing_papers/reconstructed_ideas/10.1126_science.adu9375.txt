Pluripotent stem cells, which can form gastruloids, are induced to develop vascular networks through the application of vascular-inducing factors. These vascularized gastruloids, which model human embryos, facilitate the examination of vascular integration with other developmental processes. The spatial organization of these vascular networks, mirroring human embryos, is a specific aspect of their study. These vascularized gastruloids are further combined with cardiac organoids and hepatic organoids to explore vascular interactions with distinct developing tissues, thereby elucidating vascularization within the broader developmental program.
