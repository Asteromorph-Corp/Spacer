The concept explores the chromosomal content within the haploid nuclei of the plant pathogenic fungi *Sclerotinia sclerotiorum* and *Botrytis cinerea*. This idea introduces the hypothesis that these nuclei may not retain all chromosomes. The approach employs fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-generated probes, to visualize chromosomes and determine their presence. Flow cytometry is utilized to measure DNA content, providing a method to assess if nuclei possess incomplete chromosome sets. The research idea further investigates the chromosomal distribution within distinct nuclear compartments.
