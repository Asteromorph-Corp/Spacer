TDP-43 forms cytosolic aggregates in neurodegenerative diseases and associates with stress granules under oxidative stress. The RRM1 domain of TDP-43, containing cysteines prone to disulfide bond formation under oxidative conditions, engages in hydrophobic patch interactions. This intra-condensate demixing within stress granules involves the RRM1 domain. Additionally, the C-terminal domain of TDP-43, which phase separates and undergoes a concentration-dependent phase transition, contributes to the formation of these cytosolic aggregates.
