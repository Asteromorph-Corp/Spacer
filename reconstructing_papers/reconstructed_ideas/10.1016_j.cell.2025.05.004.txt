The absence of data regarding the biomass and distribution of pelagic fungi, which are excluded from biogeochemical models, suggests a critical knowledge gap. This research aims to develop methodologies to measure fungal biomass in the open ocean, considering that existing approaches for bacterial and archaeal biomass may not apply. The methods involve using Ergosterol as a biomarker, Calcofluor-White staining for chitin and cellulose detection, fluorescence in situ hybridization with genetic probes, and a microfluidic mass sensor capable of measuring picogram-scale masses. These techniques will allow the quantification of pelagic fungi across different ocean basins and their comparison to bacterial and archaeal biomass.
