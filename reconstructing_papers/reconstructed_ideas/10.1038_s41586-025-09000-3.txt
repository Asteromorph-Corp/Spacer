STAT3 and STAT5 are critical transcription factors, with STAT3 promoting and STAT5 restricting dendritic cell-mediated T cell priming. The efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade therapy can be enhanced by modulating STAT3 and STAT5 signaling. JAK2 inhibitors have been used to target STAT3 and STAT5 signaling, but their impact is limited by the dual and opposing roles of STAT3 and STAT5 in dendritic cells. Proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC) degraders, such as SD-36 and SD-2301, offer a novel approach to address this limitation. These degraders specifically target STAT3 and STAT5 for degradation, respectively, thereby disrupting their transcriptional crosstalk. The concept involves leveraging these PROTAC degraders to reprogram dendritic cell transcriptional networks, enhancing their immunogenicity and synergizing with immune checkpoint blockade therapy.
