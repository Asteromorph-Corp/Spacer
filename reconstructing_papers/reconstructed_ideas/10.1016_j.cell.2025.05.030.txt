The research idea explores genome rearrangements in a formicoid ancestor and their role in superorganismal colony life. The proposal centers on understanding how conserved syntenic blocks, housing co-expressed genes essential for digestion, endocrine signaling, cuticular hydrocarbon synthesis, and chemoreception, facilitate colonial functionality. This approach also aims to identify gene families under selection that contribute to social organization and Queen-worker dimorphism. The study further seeks to uncover selection signatures within signaling pathways and metabolic pathways, revealing their connection to social traits and caste phenotypes. Finally, the research idea employs comparative genomic analysis to determine the genetic regulators of caste development and their evolutionary origins.
