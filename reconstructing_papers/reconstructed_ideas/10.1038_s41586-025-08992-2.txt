DNA methylation reprogramming during mammalian early development is characterized by genome-wide demethylation. This process targets gamete differentially methylated regions (gDMRs), which are critical for imprinting mechanisms. The study aims to compare DNA methylation reprogramming dynamics between marsupials (opossum Monodelphis domestica) and eutherians (mouse and human), focusing on cross-lineage comparisons of trophectoderm and epiblast. Additionally, the research investigates the potential connection between RSX noncoding RNA, a key player in marsupial X inactivation, and DNA methylation reprogramming.
