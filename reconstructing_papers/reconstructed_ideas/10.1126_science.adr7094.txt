Signaling proteins undergo conformational changes mediated by specific intradomain geometries, which function as switch mechanisms. The dynamic changes in these protein structures, their distinct protein conformations, and the conformational landscape are analyzed with deep learning. This approach provides atomic-level precision to elucidate how orthosteric ligands and allosteric mutations induce switching behavior. Physics-based simulations of conformational dynamics are leveraged to de novo construct proteins with tunable conformational switches, enabling the study of dynamic signaling mechanisms.
