The concept proposes that clonal expansion of basal cells, initiated by carcinogen exposure, underlies the progression of squamous lung lesions. This expansion generates mutated clones that spread throughout the airways, contributing to field cancerization. To explore this, multi-site sequencing across the entire bronchial tree is proposed to map the clonal dynamics of these basal cells. This approach aims to investigate how the fate of individual basal cells influences clonal expansion and the development of squamous lesions.
