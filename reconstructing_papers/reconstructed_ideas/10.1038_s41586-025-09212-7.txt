The limited clinical efficacy of CAR T cells in solid tumours arises from immunosuppressive microenvironments, antigen heterogeneity, and insufficient tumour infiltration. Armoured CAR T cells, genetically engineered to secrete cytokines, aim to sustain antitumour efficacy by promoting polyfunctionality and antitumour immunity. However, constitutive cytokine expression often induces systemic toxicity. This concept proposes engineering CAR T cells with tumour-localized cytokine expression by CRISPR knock-in of cytokine genes into endogenous genes. The strategy involves inserting cytokine genes into loci, such as NR4A2 or RGS16, under the control of promoters that are regulated by tumour-specific factors. This approach ensures cytokine production is restricted to the tumour site, thereby enhancing antitumour efficacy while minimizing systemic toxicity.
