The concept that a TCA cycle enzyme, αKG dehydrogenase (OGDH), acting as a component of intermediary metabolism, may influence cell fate in intestinal tissue is suggested. This idea arises from OGDH's role in modulating intracellular αKG levels and the proposed downstream effect of αKG on chromatin-modifying enzymes. Such a mechanism would link intermediary metabolism to the regulation of lineage-determining transcription factors, such as HNF4, which drive secretory cell differentiation.
