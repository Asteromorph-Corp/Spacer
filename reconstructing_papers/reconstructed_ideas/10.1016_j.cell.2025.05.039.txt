Growth hormone pulsatility is regulated by the antagonistic interplay between somatostatin (SST) neurons and growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) neurons in the arcuate nucleus, with their axonal projections converging at the median eminence. Sleep architecture, characterized by alternating rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM (NREM) phases, is proposed to influence growth hormone pulsatility. The neural activity of the locus coeruleus during REM sleep is posited to suppress growth hormone release through hypothalamic circuits, thereby modulating the dynamic interaction between SST and GHRH neurons.
