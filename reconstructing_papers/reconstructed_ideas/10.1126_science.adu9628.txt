The research idea explores the relationship between geometric encoding of cellular identity and mitotic symmetry during morphogenesis. It proposes that cell shape and division patterns, specifically asymmetric division and isomorphic division, directly influence cellular identity. This concept is investigated through morphometric analyses of endothelial cells and mesenchymal-like cells during mitosis. The study aims to elucidate how the geometric code, comprising cell shape and mitotic symmetry, interacts with fate determinants, such as Rab4-positive endosomes, to establish and maintain cellular heterogeneity.
