The idea proposes that genetic changes in two enzymes, MTOX and DSS, which are involved in sulfur compound production, lead to amino acid substitutions that alter their enzymatic functions. This altered enzyme activity affects the production of the sulfur compound dimethyl disulfide (DMDS), which is a key attractant for pollinators. The study further suggests that these genetic and functional variations in MTOX and DSS enzymes explain differences in DMDS production across multiple plant genera, thereby influencing pollinator attraction.
