The study explores the role of macrophage-derived oncostatin M (OSM) in supporting epithelial proliferation and lung epithelial homeostasis during viral infection. While type I interferon responses are critical for combating viral infection, OSM, a growth factor produced by activated macrophages, is hypothesized to directly promote alveolar type II epithelial cell proliferation. This hypothesis is tested using OSM-deficient mice subjected to influenza infection, revealing that OSM is essential for maintaining lung epithelial barrier function. The research idea further proposes delivering OSM to address epithelial barrier dysfunction and utilizing organoid formation assays to demonstrate that OSM directly supports epithelial proliferation.
