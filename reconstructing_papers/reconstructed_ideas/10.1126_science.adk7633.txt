The colon's distinct environment, characterized by a specific pH, microbiota, and enzymes, necessitates tailored drug delivery strategies. Gut bacteria produce glycosidases, enzymes capable of cleaving glycosidic bonds in dietary fiber. This research proposes exploiting these bacterial glycosidases to achieve site-specific activation of anti-inflammatory prodrugs in the colon. The concept introduces GlycoCaging, a method where anti-inflammatory drugs are conjugated to dietary fiber-derived oligosaccharides, such as cellobiose, through glycosidic bonds. This glycoconjugate remains intact until encountering glycosidases in the colon, enabling controlled drug release.
