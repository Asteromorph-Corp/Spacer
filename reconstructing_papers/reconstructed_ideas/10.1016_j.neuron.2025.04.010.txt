Alzheimer's disease, characterized by amyloid-beta accumulation, involves parvalbumin-positive interneurons and their synaptic machinery. This research idea posits that amyloid-beta accumulation leads to functional deficits in parvalbumin-positive interneurons, disrupting excitatory input. The study proposes using two-photon Ca2+ imaging to visualize Ca2+ transients in parvalbumin-positive interneurons and Neuropixels recordings to assess neuronal activity in AD mouse models during visual cortex stimulation. The research specifically examines the role of neuronal pentraxin 2 and its interaction with GluA4 in mediating these functional deficits.
