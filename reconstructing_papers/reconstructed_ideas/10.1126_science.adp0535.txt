The intestine must develop regulatory T cells that suppress immune responses to innocuous food proteins. Antigen-presenting cells in mesenteric lymph nodes present food proteins to T cells, inducing differentiation into peripherally-derived regulatory T cells. The presence of a Thetis cell subset, TC IV, in mesenteric lymph nodes during the peri-weaning period suggests their involvement in presenting food proteins to generate peripherally-derived regulatory T cells, thereby establishing the oral tolerance phenomenon.
