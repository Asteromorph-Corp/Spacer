The inhibition of mycobacterial PurF, a critical enzyme in the de novo purine biosynthesis pathway, disrupts the production of nucleobases required for DNA replication, leading to a bactericidal mechanism. JNJ-6640, a small-molecule inhibitor of PurF, depletes purine availability, and its bactericidal mechanism is investigated at the single-cell level. This research explores the potential of JNJ-6640 formulated as a long-acting injectable for the treatment of tuberculosis, including drug-resistant strains.
