The research idea centers around exploring the role of the CUL5-ASB7 ubiquitin ligase complex in heterochromatin homeostasis. H3K9me3 and HP1 are key components of heterochromatin, with SUV39H1 catalyzing H3K9me3. The CUL5-ASB7 complex, functioning as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, is hypothesized to target SUV39H1 for degradation, thereby modulating H3K9me3 levels. CDK1 phosphorylation is proposed to activate this CUL5-ASB7 complex, linking heterochromatin regulation to the cell cycle. CRISPR-Cas9 technology would be employed to knock out CUL5, ASB7, or CDK1, enabling an investigation into their roles in maintaining heterochromatin structure during mitosis.
