Split inteins, which facilitate protein splicing, require prior split site insertion in the target protein. Genetic code expansion, enabling noncanonical amino acid insertion into cellular proteins, offers a novel approach to overcome this limitation. This concept proposes utilizing genetic code expansion to insert an exogenous split site via epitope tagging of endogenous cellular proteins, thereby enabling split intein mediated protein splicing in a site-specific manner.
