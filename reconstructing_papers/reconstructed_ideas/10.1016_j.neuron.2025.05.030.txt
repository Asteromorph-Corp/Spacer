A research idea focuses on homeostatic plasticity mechanisms that adjust synaptic strength. In Drosophila cholinergic and mammalian glutamatergic systems, semaphorin and Sema3a emerge as trans-synaptic messengers. These molecules are proposed to act within the synaptic cleft, particularly at CA1 hippocampal synapses and Drosophila cholinergic synapses. The research idea involves identifying Sema3a as a trans-synaptic messenger mediating homeostatic plasticity through structural changes. These structural changes, visualized through electron microscopy, include active zone expansion and vesicle redistribution. The interaction between Sema3a and the presynaptic PlexinA4 receptor, alongside postsynaptic integrin beta-1, is central to this mechanism.
