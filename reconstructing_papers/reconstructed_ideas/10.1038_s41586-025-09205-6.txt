The structural and functional properties of metabolic enzymes are shaped by the interplay of their intrinsic biochemical characteristics and the constraints imposed by the metabolic network. The AlphaFold2 program enables accurate structural modeling of Saccharomycotina enzymes, revealing how structural elements, such as metal ion binding sites and small-molecule-binding residues, sustain catalytic function despite sequence divergence. Structural biology approaches further resolve the distinct evolutionary trajectories of surface and buried residues, highlighting their unique selection pressures from metabolic flux and biosynthetic cost. Integrating evolutionary genomics with structural models uncovers how amino acid substitutions map to specific structural features, elucidating the constraints imposed by metabolic network architecture on enzyme evolution.
