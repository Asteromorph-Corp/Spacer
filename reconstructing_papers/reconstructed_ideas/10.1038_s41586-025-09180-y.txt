The sensory cortex displays neural plasticity through both supervised and unsupervised learning. The primary visual cortex, V1, is studied under two distinct learning conditions, a rewarded task and stimulus exposure without reward. These conditions are used to identify different neural changes, leading to the establishment of distinct visual learning rules. The study further investigates whether these learning rules are exclusive to V1 or extend to other cortical areas. The research hypothesizes that reward-prediction signals from anterior higher visual areas influence V1, suggesting that these areas might employ different learning rules. This forms a comprehensive learning framework integrating both supervised and unsupervised learning principles.
