The detection of ancient humans' DNA fragments containing bacterial, viral, and parasite species allows for the identification of pathogen presence through archaeogenetic data. The approach involves examining the microbial DNA within these ancient human DNA fragments to reveal bacterial, viral, and parasite species. This examination provides insights into reservoir types and transmission modes, distinguishing between zoonotic pathogens originating from animal hosts and other pathogens. The study focuses on Eurasian populations undergoing cultural transitions, particularly during livestock domestication, to explore these dynamics.
