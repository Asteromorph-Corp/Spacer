The amnion is an essential extra-embryonic structure that surrounds and protects the developing embryo during amniogenesis. A research idea is proposed to study amniogenesis by generating in vitro models of the human amnion, termed amnioids, through the self-organization of human embryonic stem cells and human extra-embryonic mesoderm cells in three-dimensional cultures. This approach allows for the mechanistic analysis of amniogenesis, specifically focusing on the role of GATA3 and autoregulatory feedback loops that mediate embryo-amnion interactions. These amnioids also provide a platform for pharmacological studies, bridging to clinical investigations.
