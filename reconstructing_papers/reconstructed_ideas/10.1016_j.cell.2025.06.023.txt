The humanized mouse model engrafted with human CD34+ cells and infected with human T-cell leukemia virus type 1c (HTLV-1c) provides a platform to evaluate the antiviral activities of tenofovir and dolutegravir. This model allows for the identification of antiretroviral mechanisms that disrupt HTLV-1c replication. The study employs single-cell RNA sequencing and intracellular flow cytometry to characterize the transcriptome of infected cells and detect signaling proteins in apoptotic pathways. The analysis of MCL-1 and BH3 mimetics further explores apoptotic dysregulation in HTLV-1c-infected cells.
