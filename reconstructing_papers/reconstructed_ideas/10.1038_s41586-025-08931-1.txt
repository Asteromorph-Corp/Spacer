The study proposes that NRAS(Q61*) mutations in melanoma drive the formation of a neomorph complex, distinct from other RAS isoforms, involving SHOC2, MRAS, and PP1C. This complex, specifically associated with RAS(Q61*) mutants, sustains MAPK signaling and proliferation. The research idea involves validating this complex in RAS(Q61R)-mutant melanoma and RAS-mutant cancer models. A high-throughput screening approach is proposed to identify small molecules that disrupt SHOC2-binding, targeting this unique complex.
