The brain's intricate neural circuits rely on precise synaptic connections, yet their nanoscale organization and molecular details in intact brains remain difficult to resolve with standard light microscopy. A method that combines hydrogel-based embedding and expansion with deep-learning segmentation, termed LICONN, is designed to address this challenge. This approach enables the mapping of synaptic connectivity across entire circuits in intact mouse brains at nanoscale resolution.
