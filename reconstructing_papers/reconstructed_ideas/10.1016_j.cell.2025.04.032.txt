CD8 T cells upregulate the serotonin transporter (SERT) upon activation, leading to increased serotonin reuptake. This serotonin functions as a negative-feedback regulator that intrinsically limits CD8 T cell antitumor immunity, akin to an immune checkpoint. Blocking SERT with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) disrupts this intrinsic serotonin-mediated limitation. Combining SERT blockade with PD-1 blockade enhances antitumor immunity by targeting both the novel CD8 T cell-intrinsic serotonin axis and the established PD-1 immune checkpoint.
