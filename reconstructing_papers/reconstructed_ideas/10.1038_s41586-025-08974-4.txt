Persister cancer cells, such as CD44high cells in sarcoma and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, exhibit a metabolic dependency on phospholipids and utilize lysosomal phospholipid degradation to maintain their survival. The study aims to explore the ability of phospholipid degraders to compromise the viability of these persister cancer cells. Additionally, the research investigates whether RSL3, an inducer of ferroptosis, can effectively eliminate these cells by triggering this specific form of cell death.
