The cerebellum uses competitive interactions among Purkinje cells (P cells) to resolve redundancies in motor control, implementing null space theory. These competitive mechanisms, mediated by molecular layer interneurons (MLIs), enable the selection of optimal motor outputs. A spiking model of the P cell population demonstrates how these competitive interactions, driven by mossy fiber inputs conveying both motor command and movement goal, terminate movement accurately. This model shows that movement termination arises from the population dynamics of the P cells.
