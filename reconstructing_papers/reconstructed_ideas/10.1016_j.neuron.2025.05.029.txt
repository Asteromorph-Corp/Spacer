Dendrites of GABAergic interneurons, particularly SST-expressing cells, exhibit NMDAR-dependent supralinear integration of synaptic inputs, influenced by their synaptic distribution and temporal integration. In contrast, PV-expressing cells display sublinear integration, with synapses located proximally. A compartmental modeling approach examines how these dendritic properties relate to synaptic efficacy and dynamic responses. The study then tests these models by assessing the dynamic responses of PV-INs and SST-INs to visual stimuli in the living brain.
