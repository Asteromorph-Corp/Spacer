The concept of amino acid removal driving weight loss in mice, despite their metabolic roles, is explored. Cysteine, a sulfur-containing amino acid, is hypothesized to regulate glutathione (GSH) production, essential for redox balance, and coenzyme A (CoA) levels, critical for mitochondrial energy. The dual metabolic disruption of both GSH and CoA is proposed to activate integrated and oxidative stress responses. This dual metabolic disruption is anticipated to release GDF15 and FGF21, hormones known to modulate metabolic stress. The metabolic roles of cysteine in maintaining mitochondrial energy via CoA and supporting redox balance via GSH are central to this hypothesis. Additionally, the interplay between anaerobic glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, such as pyruvate, orotate, citrate, and Î±-ketoglutarate, is considered in the context of this dual disruption.
