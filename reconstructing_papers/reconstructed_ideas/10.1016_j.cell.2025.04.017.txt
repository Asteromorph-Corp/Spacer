The study explores how combinations of transcription factor binding sites within enhancers determine cell-state-specific gene expression. Synthetic DNA models of enhancers, systematically varying transcription factor binding site combinatorics, are introduced into hematopoietic progenitor cell states. These enhancer models are tested in blood stem cells and their differentiating myeloid lineages. The approach integrates transcription factor occupancy with gene expression to identify rules governing enhancer function. The research specifically focuses on how activating sites and their repressive functional counterparts generate negative synergies, which repress, rather than activate, gene expression.
