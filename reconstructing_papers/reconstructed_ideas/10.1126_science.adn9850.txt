During *Heligmosomoides polygyrus* infection, immune responses and inflammation are characterized by the production of *IL-4* and *IL-13*. These cytokines modulate the expression of *neuromedin U* (NMU) and *calcitonin gene-related peptide β* (CGRPβ) in *enteric neurons*. This modulation occurs through *signaling* pathways involving the *IL-13* receptor *Il13ra1* expressed on *enteric neurons*.
