The segregation of eukaryotic genomes into A and B compartments, and their underlying condensability differences, may arise from the binding of polyamines to nucleosomes. These polyamines, by altering nucleosome arrangement, modify the condensability of chromosomal regions, thereby influencing gene expression. Chromatin polymer simulations predict that cellular polyamine availability, governed by ornithine decarboxylase, modulates the three-dimensional genome architecture through these nucleosome-polyamine interactions.
