Centromeres, specialized chromatin regions, are hypothesized to be composed of unique DNA motifs arranged with specific spacing patterns that dictate chromosome architecture. A centeny map, derived from Genomic Centromere Profiling, reveals these DNA motifs and their spacing patterns. Structural models of centromeric regions are generated based on these unique DNA motif arrangements. This approach provides insights into centromere expansion and structural variants, while also offering a foundation for chromosome annotation and assembly.
