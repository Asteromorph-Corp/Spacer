Kupffer cells, the liver-resident macrophages, are critical for erythrocyte recycling and metabolic support of hepatocyte lipid uptake and apolipoprotein secretion. Maternal obesity during gestation impairs Kupffer cell liver colonization. This developmental programming leads to heightened hepatocyte lipid uptake, reduced apolipoprotein secretion, and subsequent fatty liver disease in neonates. The metabolic adaptation of Kupffer cells, which involves HIF1Î±-mediated suppression of oxidative phosphorylation and activation of glycolysis, is disrupted by maternal obesity. This disruption in Kupffer cell metabolism contributes to the observed fatty liver disease in neonates.
