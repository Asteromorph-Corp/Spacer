Plasmodium falciparum, the human malaria parasite, resides in red blood cells where it induces jaundice, a condition characterized by elevated levels of bilirubin. The parasite's hemozoin crystallization activity generates unconjugated bilirubin, a lipid-soluble molecule, and conjugated bilirubin, a water-soluble molecule. Unconjugated bilirubin, but not conjugated bilirubin, exerts inhibitory effects on the parasite's mitochondria, impeding pyrimidine synthesis and thereby hindering parasite proliferation. The host enzymes biliverdin reductase A and UDP glucuronosyltransferase 1A1, which convert biliverdin to bilirubin and conjugate bilirubin, respectively, are modulated by the parasite as part of its metabolic defense strategy. This modulation represents a novel mechanism by which Plasmodium falciparum controls its proliferation within the host.
