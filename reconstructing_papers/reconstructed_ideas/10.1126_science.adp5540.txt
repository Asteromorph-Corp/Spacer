The research idea focuses on metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) and its association with ceramide metabolism, specifically involving CerS6. The concept proposes that the intestinal symbiont Fusarium foetens, known for producing secondary metabolites, yields a CerS6 inhibitor, FF-C1. The study aims to test the hypothesis that FF-C1, a secondary metabolite of Fusarium foetens, can ameliorate MASH in mouse models.
