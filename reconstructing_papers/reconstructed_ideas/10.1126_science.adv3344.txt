The Retron-Septu antiphage defense system functions through the production of multiple copies of single-stranded DNA (msDNA) by reverse transcriptase. This system employs msdDNA, msrRNA, and the PtuAB protein complex to bind a specific DNA-binding site. The binding and subsequent release from this site occur through a dynamic arrest-and-release mechanism, which directly impedes phage replication.
