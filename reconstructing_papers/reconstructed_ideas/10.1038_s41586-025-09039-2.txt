A novel approach to malaria control involves developing long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) treated with transmission-blocking compounds targeting the Plasmodium falciparum parasite during its mosquito stages. The concept centers on inhibiting the parasite's development within the Anopheles midgut lumen using endochin-like quinolones (ELQ compounds), which specifically target the cytochrome bc1 complex (CytB). These ELQ compounds are incorporated into polyethylene films on LLINs to ensure sustained release. This approach aims to provide continuous exposure to transmission-blocking insecticides, thereby addressing the challenge of insecticide-resistant mosquitoes.
