The Denisovans, an extinct hominin group known from genomic data, have their evolutionary history and biological characteristics primarily inferred from ancient DNA. The Harbin cranium, a fossil specimen classified as Homo longi, presents distinct morphological traits. To address the taxonomic status of Homo longi, this study proposes extracting protein data from the Harbin cranium. The amino acid variants within this protein data would then undergo molecular clustering alongside the known Denisova 3 protein sequences. This approach aims to establish whether the genetic signatures derived from the Harbin cranium's protein sequences align with those of the Denisovans, thereby resolving the taxonomic relationship between Homo longi and the Denisovans.
