The stromal niche surrounding leukaemia stem cells (LSCs) is a critical environment supporting oncogenic progression. This niche comprises distinct osteolineage cells that provide metabolic support to LSCs. Single-cell RNA-sequencing and CRISPR screens identify LSC dependencies within this niche. A key dependency involves taurine metabolism, specifically the taurine-taurine transporter (TAUT) and cysteine dioxygenase type 1 (CDO1). Osteolineage cells uniquely express CDO1, enabling taurine biosynthesis, while LSCs rely on TAUT-mediated taurine uptake. This taurine metabolism promotes oncogenic progression by driving mTOR signaling and glycolysis in LSCs. Additionally, CDO1 expression in the stromal niche contributes to venetoclax resistance in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) by activating anti-apoptotic pathways in LSCs.
