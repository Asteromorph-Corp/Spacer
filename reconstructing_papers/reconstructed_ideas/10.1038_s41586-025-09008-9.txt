Learning in the absence of reward is hypothesized to rely on action prediction error rather than reward prediction error. This concept proposes that movement-based prediction errors, not reward-based errors, drive the formation of value-free associations. The striatum may implement this action prediction error to guide sound-action learning. To investigate this, neural activity in the striatum is monitored in mice during an auditory discrimination task designed to isolate value-free associative learning. Causal manipulations of dopaminergic signals and computational modelling are employed to test whether movement-based prediction errors, distinct from reward prediction errors, underlie the formation of these value-free associations.
