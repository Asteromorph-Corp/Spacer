The noncoding genome is a potential source of cryptic peptides presented by human leukocyte antigen class I (HLA-I) molecules. These cryptic peptides are considered to drive cancer specificity, particularly in pancreatic cancer. The immunopeptidome of pancreatic cancer, characterized by immunopeptidomics, comprises HLA-I ligands derived from the noncoding genome. These cryptic HLA-I ligands are hypothesized to prime T cells, leading to cytotoxic T cell responses through specific T cell receptor (TCR) interactions. The tumoricidal capacity of these T cell responses can be studied using pancreatic cancer organoids, providing a model to assess their potential as therapeutic targets.
