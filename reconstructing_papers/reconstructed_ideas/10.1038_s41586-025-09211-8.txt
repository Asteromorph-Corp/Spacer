The integration of connectomes and spatial transcriptomes with single-cell resolution into three-dimensional brain atlases requires a precise and standardized spatial framework. To achieve this, a Nissl-based cytoarchitecture, derived from micro-optical sectioning tomography with isotropic 1-Î¼m resolution, serves as the foundation for three-dimensional reconstruction. The integration of multi-modal images into this framework and its application in stereotaxic surgery planning necessitate an informatics-based platform. This platform should also enable cross-atlas navigation systems, incorporating anatomical planes and coordinate systems for comprehensive spatial referencing.
