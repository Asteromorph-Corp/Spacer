Examining the spatial relationships of gene expression in developing cortical areas, such as V1 and V2, across developmental time represents a fundamental approach to understanding areal specification. This investigation employs MERFISH technology to map spatially resolved gene expression profiles and combines this with single-nucleus RNA sequencing to identify distinct excitatory neuron subtypes. The approach incorporates deep learning for nucleus segmentation to analyze laminar organization and synaptogenesis. This integrative methodology is designed to reveal the temporal dynamics of gene expression during the development of cortical areas.
