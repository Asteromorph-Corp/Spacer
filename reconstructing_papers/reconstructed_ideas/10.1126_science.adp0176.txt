The study of ear pinna regeneration in mammals reveals a dual role for retinoic acid (RA), acting both as a pro-regenerative signal and a regenerative inhibitor. Aldh1a2, responsible for RA synthesis, and RA degradation pathways are central to this process. Single-cell and spatial transcriptomics will map cell types and gene expression patterns in regenerative and non-regenerative ear pinna models. The activation of Aldh1a2 and RA supplementation in non-regenerative species aim to overcome RA deficiency. Additionally, regulatory elements controlling Aldh1a2 expression and transgenic approaches will test RA sufficiency. Evolutionary analysis of Aldh1a2 regulatory elements will determine their role in the emergence of ear pinna regeneration.
