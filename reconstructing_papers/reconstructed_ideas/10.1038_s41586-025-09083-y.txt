Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a complex psychiatric condition, and understanding its underlying perturbed pathways requires a comprehensive approach. The use of single-nucleus sequencing and spatial transcriptomics in the postmortem dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) of individuals with PTSD and controls allows the identification of cell-type-specific transcriptional responses. This approach facilitates the integration of genetic, transcriptomic, and epigenetic data to pinpoint credible variants and their regulatory mechanisms. The perturbed pathways are localized to specific cell types, including SST-expressing inhibitory neurons, endothelial cells, and microglia. These pathways are associated with glucocorticoid signaling, GABAergic transmission, and neuroinflammation, and involve key genes such as SST, FKBP5, ELFN1, MAD1L1, and KCNIP4.
