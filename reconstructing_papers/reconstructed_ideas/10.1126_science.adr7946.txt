Birds consuming acidic fruits, such as citrus, exhibit avian taste perception modifications. These modifications may involve sour tolerance mediated by receptor modulation. The proton channel OTOP1, known to mediate acid-induced inhibition in other species, could underlie this avian sour tolerance. Songbirds, which have lost sweet sensing, and other avian species with distinct taste perception, offer comparative models to study these taste modifications. Ancestral reconstruction approaches can trace the evolutionary history of these avian taste perception traits, potentially linking them to specific evolutionary radiations.
