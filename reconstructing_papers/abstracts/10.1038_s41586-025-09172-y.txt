Abstract Mitotic onset is a critical transition for eukaryotic cell proliferation. The commonly held view of mitotic control is that the master regulator, cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK), is first activated in the cytoplasm, at the centrosome, initiating mitosis 1–3 . Bistability in CDK activation ensures that the transition is irreversible, but how this unfolds in a spatially compartmentalized cell is unknown 4–8 . Here, using fission yeast, we show that CDK is first activated in the nucleus, and that the bistable responses differ markedly between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, with a stronger response in the nucleus driving mitotic signal propagation from there to the cytoplasm. Abolishing cyclin–CDK localization to the centrosome led to activation occurring only in the nucleus, spatially uncoupling the nucleus and cytoplasm mitotically, suggesting that centrosomal cyclin–CDK acts as a ‘signal relayer’. We propose that the key mitotic regulatory system operates in the nucleus in proximity to DNA, which enables incomplete DNA replication and DNA damage to be effectively monitored to preserve genome integrity and to integrate ploidy within the CDK control network. This spatiotemporal regulatory framework establishes core principles for control of the onset of mitosis and highlights that the CDK control system operates within distinct regulatory domains in the nucleus and cytoplasm.
