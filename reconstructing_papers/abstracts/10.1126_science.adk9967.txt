Mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) is an adaptor involved in antiviral immunity, but its regulation is not fully understood. We identified carboxylation of MAVS by vitamin K (VK)–dependent γ-glutamyl carboxylase (GGCX), which was unexpected owing to the reported membrane topology of GGCX. We found that GGCX could undergo topology inversion to carboxylate MAVS within the cytoplasm. This carboxylation enhanced the ability of MAVS to induce type I interferons while suppressing the induction of apoptosis. Genetic knockout of GGCX, a VK-free diet, or depletion of VK by inhibiting VK epoxide reductase 1 with warfarin increased viral susceptibility in mice. Thus, we identified a MAVS regulatory mechanism—the existence of cytoplasmic protein carboxylation and topological inversion of GGCX—and demonstrated how modulating VK levels may influence antiviral defense.
