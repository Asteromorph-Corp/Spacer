Following fertilization, the preimplantation embryo undergoes successive rounds of cell division and must accurately propagate the genetic material to ensure successful development. However, early mammalian embryos lack efficient spindle assembly mechanisms, and it remains unclear how error-free chromosome segregation is achieved. In this work, we imaged early mouse embryos and identified a network of nuclear actin cables that organize prophase chromosomes at the nuclear periphery. Following nuclear envelope breakdown, the network contracts and gathers chromosomes toward the cell center. Network contraction was driven by filament disassembly in a myosin II-independent manner. Additionally, we identified a network of branched actin filaments that attenuates metaphase spindle elongation. We also visualized nuclear actin in human embryos, suggesting a conserved role for actin in ensuring mitotic fidelity during early mammalian development.
