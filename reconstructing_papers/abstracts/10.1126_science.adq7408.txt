The maintenance of H3K9me3 involves the recognition of pre-existing modifications by HP1, which recruits methyltransferase SUV39H1 to methylate the adjacent newly incorporated histones, thereby establishing a positive feedback loop. However, how this positive feedback is restricted to maintain H3K9me3 homeostasis remains largely unknown. Here, we performed an unbiased genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 screen and identified CUL5 ASB7 E3 ubiquitin ligase as a negative regulator of H3K9me3. ASB7 is recruited to heterochromatin by HP1 and promotes SUV39H1 degradation. During mitosis, CDK1 phosphorylates ASB7, preventing its interaction with SUV39H1, leading to SUV39H1 stabilization and H3K9me3 restoration. Our findings reveal a dynamic circuit involving HP1, SUV39H1, and ASB7 that governs H3K9me3 homeostasis, thereby ensuring faithful epigenetic inheritance and preventing excessive heterochromatin formation.
