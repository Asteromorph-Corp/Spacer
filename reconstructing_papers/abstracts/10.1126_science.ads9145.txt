Preinvasive squamous lung lesions are precursors of lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC). The cellular events underlying lesion formation are unknown. Using a carcinogen-induced model of LUSC with no added genetic hits or cell type bias, we find that carcinogen exposure leads to non-neutral competition among basal cells, aberrant clonal expansions, and basal cell mobilization along the airways. Ultimately, preinvasive lesions develop from a few highly mutated clones that dominate most of the bronchial tree. Multi-site sequencing in human patients confirms the presence of clonally related preinvasive lesions across distinct airway regions. Our work identifies a transition in basal cell clonal dynamics, and an associated shift in basal cell fate, as drivers of field cancerization in the lung.
