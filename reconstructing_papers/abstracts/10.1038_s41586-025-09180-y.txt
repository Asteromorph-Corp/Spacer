Abstract Representation learning in neural networks may be implemented with supervised or unsupervised algorithms, distinguished by the availability of instruction. In the sensory cortex, perceptual learning drives neural plasticity 1â€“13 , but it is not known whether this is due to supervised or unsupervised learning. Here we recorded populations of up to 90,000 neurons simultaneously from the primary visual cortex (V1) and higher visual areas (HVAs) while mice learned multiple tasks, as well as during unrewarded exposure to the same stimuli. Similar to previous studies, we found that neural changes in task mice were correlated with their behavioural learning. However, the neural changes were mostly replicated in mice with unrewarded exposure, suggesting that the changes were in fact due to unsupervised learning. The neural plasticity was highest in the medial HVAs and obeyed visual, rather than spatial, learning rules. In task mice only, we found a ramping reward-prediction signal in anterior HVAs, potentially involved in supervised learning. Our neural results predict that unsupervised learning may accelerate subsequent task learning, a prediction that we validated with behavioural experiments.
