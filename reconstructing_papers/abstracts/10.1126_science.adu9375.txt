Although model organisms have provided insight into the earliest stages of cardiac and hepatic vascularization, we know very little about this process in humans because of ethical restrictions and the technical difficulty of obtaining embryos during very early development. In this study, we demonstrate that micropatterned human pluripotent stem cellâ€“derived gastruloids enable in vitro modeling of the earliest stages of vascularization. We identify a combination of vascular-inducing factors that give rise to cardiac vascularized organoids with a spatially organized and branched vascular network. To show the broader utility of our vascularization strategy, we use the same vascular-inducing factors to produce hepatic vascularized organoids. Our results suggest that a conserved developmental program generates the vasculature within different types of organs.
