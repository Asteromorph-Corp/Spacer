Present vision restoration technologies have substantial constraints that limit their application in the clinical setting. In this work, we fabricated a subretinal nanoprosthesis using tellurium nanowire networks (TeNWNs) that converts light of both the visible and near-infraredâ€“II spectra into electrical signals. The broad-spectrum coverage is made possible by a combination of narrow bandgaps, strong absorption, and engineered asymmetries. Implanted into blind mice, the TeNWNs restored pupillary reflexes and enabled visually cued learning under visible and near-infrared 1550-nanometer light. In nonhuman primates, TeNWNs elicited robust retina-derived neural responses, confirming biocompatibility and feasibility. By restoring lost photosensitivity and extending vision to near-infrared, this nanoprosthesis offers a promising approach for restoring vision.
