We present an enhancer-AAV toolbox for accessing and perturbing striatal cell types and circuits. Best-in-class vectors were curated for accessing major striatal neuron populations including medium spiny neurons (MSNs), direct- and indirect-pathway MSNs, Sst-Chodl, Pvalb-Pthlh, and cholinergic interneurons. Specificity was evaluated by multiple modes of molecular validation, by three different routes of virus delivery, and with diverse transgene cargos. Importantly, we provide detailed information necessary to achieve reliable cell-type-specific labeling under different experimental contexts. We demonstrate direct pathway circuit-selective optogenetic perturbation of behavior and multiplex labeling of striatal interneuron types for targeted analysis of cellular features. Lastly, we show conserved in vivo activity for exemplary MSN enhancers in rats and macaques. This collection of striatal enhancer AAVs offers greater versatility compared to available transgenic lines and can readily be applied for cell type and circuit studies in diverse mammalian species beyond the mouse model.
