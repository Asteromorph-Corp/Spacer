Translation of the noncoding genome in cancer can generate cryptic (noncanonical) peptides capable of presentation by human leukocyte antigen class I (HLA-I); however, the cancer specificity and immunogenicity of noncanonical HLA-I-bound peptides (ncHLAp) are incompletely understood. Using high-resolution immunopeptidomics, we discovered that cryptic peptides are abundant in the pancreatic cancer immunopeptidome. Approximately 30% of ncHLAp exhibited cancer-restricted translation, and a substantial subset were shared among patients. Cancer-restricted ncHLAp displayed robust immunogenic potential in a sensitive ex vivo T cell priming platform. ncHLAp-reactive, T cell receptor-redirected T cells exhibited tumoricidal activity against patient-derived pancreatic cancer organoids. These findings demonstrate that pancreatic cancer harbors cancer-restricted ncHLAp that can be recognized by cytotoxic T cells. Future therapeutic strategies for pancreatic cancer, and potentially other solid tumors, may include targeting cryptic antigens.
